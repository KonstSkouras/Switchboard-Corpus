A|Uh, but, uh, no I don't really have a budget at the moment. Uh, but I have uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month and then I don't, usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car expenses and then that, then it goes through the moon, so.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd sd %

B|We're trying, we're trying to, uh, so far we are in the clear credit wise but, uh, the other side of it is, so, not much on that side of it to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but,|sd sd sd sd sd %

We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt, but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every month.|sd sd sv sd

A|Uh-huh|b
B|And, uh, came home and got married and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators. Well, I always wanted to do translation, but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere.

A|True, true enough. So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course?|aa aa qw
B|Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones, but there's, I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other, you know, since I did you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other.|sd % sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So I know the greetings in about ten, and how to do market stuff, but in about, uh, about five I guess, I can do better in it. And my French is pretty good but it's, uh, French so, uh, I'm terrified to speak in, uh in France.|sd sd sd % sd
A|In France.|^2
B|Yeah, because they're real snobby about their language and French is street French and I just picked it up off the street and I knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating, but I didn't know what I was saying. I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when I came home and French to somebody and he paled and said, uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said.

A|Must have been terrible. The, uh, was it Henry Macon said that the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that.
