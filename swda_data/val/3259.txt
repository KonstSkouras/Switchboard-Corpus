A|Right|b
B|But, um, I'm a divorced woman. I have one child|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, when, when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, I don't particularly, I think it's sort of a waste of money to go real, to a real high priced restaurant.|% sv
A|Do you go like home cooking, like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria?|qy
B|Um, Not really. We go more for the, uh, Chinese and Italian and stuff like that. Mexican, stuff that I can't cook|ng sd
A|Me too Uh-huh. Mexican, uh-huh. Uh, we do too. We do the same.|sd b b^m b sd sd

B|Uh-huh. And have you ever tried, um, the Macaroni Grill up on,|aa qy
A|Yes, we did. Now, my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna,|ny sd sd

A|And it seems like I've been, we found those one time and then they discontinued. It was over in Addison.|% sd sd sd
B|Huh.|b
