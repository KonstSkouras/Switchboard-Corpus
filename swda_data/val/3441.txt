A|Uh, what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things.|sd

A|All,  sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yes. I hate those canned messages they put on my recorder.|b aa sd
A|Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen just what went into the something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using and, uh, and, uh, people, businesses would be prohibited, uh, from calling for for, for business selling you things.|sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, that could, could be useful protection.|sv

B|Well, that's the thing I hated too about, uh, Radio Shack.|sd
A|How did Radio Shack work?|qw
B|If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number. And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning, and, and I don't give that out. I have an unlisted number so I don't,|sd sd sd sd sd

A|I'll be thinking in mind the address is , um, is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number?|sd qy
B|Uh, no. Not really. Um, no. Uh, some of that unfortunately is legal. So they can't stop people from, uh, advertising and that, and that's what it falls under. It falls under the guise of advertising. So, I don't care for it, but is it a legal, uh, solution for some companies. So that, that's the way things are.|nn ng nn sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
