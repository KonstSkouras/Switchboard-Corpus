A|Are you in the market for a car recently?|qy
B|Yeah, I just bought a car.|ny sd
A|Oh, what did you get?|qw
B|I got a nineteen ninety-three Cavalier station wagon.|sd
A|Uh-huh, what, what convinced you to get that one?|b qw
B|Well, a friend of my father's, and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh, incredible, how many miles on it?|b ba qw
B|It's like, it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand.|sd
A|And it's still running real well.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, great, yeah. We have, uh, right now we have two cars, uh, I have, my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a, um, an eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van,|ba % sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we have, um, about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, uh, uh, Audi|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, that was a you know, a sedan, and, uh, we got that. The major things, the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova, and a, well, my son was driving, and someone came into his lane and hit him, and fortunately he was able to, his, I mean he was checked out of the hospital, was out of the hospital by that night, but the car was completely totalled|sd sd % sd % % sd sd sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and Mike, and, they had been, my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that, which was hit by another car.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|So I mean, I got, I was getting really nervous, so I finally said, we, I want a really solid car. So we found the Audi second hand. I guess right now my criteria for cars is, uh, of being solid, able to take an impact|sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, so, uh, I, we're not going to be in the market for, in the near future for any new car.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But the things that I would want would be a solid car. Another thing I'd definitely want would be anti-lock brakes.|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, our, our van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have, I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible.|sd sv
B|Um.|b
A|If the road is at all wet, and I'm, and I don't go all that fast, but the, uh, it, it just doesn't hold. It doesn't hold well at all. So, I, I definitely want to get anti lock brakes. So, I don't know, do you have any particular things that, that are priorities on your list.|sd sd sd sd sd qy
B|Well, it's, I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, you know, windows and steering and air conditioning,|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and uh.|%
A|I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it.|qy
B|Uh-huh, oh, yeah. It has a stereo and a cassette player|ny ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon.|sd
A|That's incredible.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That is incredible.|ba
B|So.|%
A|Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight. The Audi does not have good mileage. That's the one drawback. It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh,|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky. Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two. It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's a, to me is a real drawback. I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight, but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning.|sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid.|sd
B|Uh-huh, it's really humid.|b sd
A|Yeah, uh, so air conditioning is uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer. Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know, power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,|aa sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it.|sd
B|Crank, yeah.|% b
A|Yeah, but, or, you know, if you want to have open windows, to be able to if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and.|b sd sd
B|Right. You don't have to stretch.|b ^2
A|But you know, I've lived all these years without them, I probably could have lived a little longer|sd sd
B|That's true.|ba
A|Uh, one of the things that we have, uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and those are really nice in good weather.|sv
B|That's right.|ba
A|So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes, I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, uh, just so it'd be a good solid car.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess that those are my major criteria. Everything else is, you know, a luxury, and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.|sd sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for?|qw
B|Um, like you said, anti-lock brakes and air bag, and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, you know, like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's,|sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah. Isn't that true. It's, it's funny, um, uh, that you use, the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable.|b b bh sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.|b sv
B|Yeah, they have parts, uh-huh.|b sd b
A|But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,|sv
B|Right,|b
A|and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, it I shudder. I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason. But I would love, I wish an American, an American, that, you know, engineering would make something as solid as a German car. You know, we certainly have the technology,|% sd sd sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|but, it's amazing, when we bought this Audi, I mean, everything is more solid in it.|sv sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, if, you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic|% sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know, and I, I, and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car. I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.|% sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, do you need air conditioning down there?|qy
B|Yes, we really do|ny sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties. So|sd %
A|Oh, we've had eleven days in a row over ninety.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that. Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you. Okay, and enjoy, enjoy your car.|sd ad fc fc fc
