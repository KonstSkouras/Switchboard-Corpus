B|Was the guinea pig for your, for your child?|qy
A|Daughter, yes. Yes, as if the dogs weren't enough, had to have, a guinea pig, so, anyway she's, she enjoys her though, so that's, that's what matters. But, um, our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years and,|^2 ny ny sd sd sd sd %

B|Oh, my, my husband's always wanted a Chow but I'm kind of concerned about, um, with having cats, and how, how they socialize with cats. Um, which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed.|sd sd
A|Oh. Right.|b b
B|Um, because we thought they would socialize easier,|sd

A|And, uh, you would think, you know, that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and, and paw at their face and they'd just play and they were never, they never harmed her.

B|So, you had the dogs before you had the baby?|qy
A|Right. And I was, not really concerned about, um, them harming her, uh, I think, I think a lot of that, that, that we hear all the time is how you bring them up.|na sd sv

A|Uh, the female's red and the male is black.|sd sd
B|Oh, I bet the black one's pretty.|qy^d
A|Yeah, he is, he's a big old thing. And, um, I was concerned about the female mainly, and as luck had it, uh, she had puppies the same week my daughter was born, so, it was kind of like, she had her babies and understood about, you know,|ny sd sd sd sd
B|About your baby.|qy^d
A|yeah, and that, yeah, I think that really helped and, um, my daughter, you know, since, since she's little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and, and get on their back or whatever and she's, she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her, so.|ny % ny sd sd sd sd %
B|Yeah, I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets, as, as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything.|b sv
A|I do, too. Yeah.|aa b
B|But I think it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses and they have pets, I see so many times kids just, you know, they, mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings.|sv sv sd sd
A|Yeah, exactly, that or, or, uh, the other extreme, they're, they're terrified of them and I hate that,|aa sv sv sd
B|Yeah, Yeah.|aa aa
A|and they shouldn't be, I mean, some maybe but, but, um, like our miniature Schnauzer, she's just, she's just like, um, a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly, and a lot of kids are scared of that. And which I understand because she is, you know, a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's,|sv % sd sd sd %
B|Huh.|b
A|it, that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing, she wouldn't you know, harm them at all and, and, and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children, so, I think, I think it's a good idea to have them. We've had, um, in the past, we've had birds, too, uh, like Cockatoos. And parrots and, The big white, birds with the, the orange crest on top.|sd sd sd sv sd

B|Are they?|bh
A|Oh, a lot louder than a dog, you know, a dog you can tell, stop barking, you know, or whatever.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think the cats would really enjoy it, um,|sd

A|That's right and they're so, independent. I love having them for that reason.|aa sd sd
B|Yeah, yeah, and until we got the dog, um, it was real easy to, to go to town for three three day weekend or whatever,|b b sd
