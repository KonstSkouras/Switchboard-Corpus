B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was particularly well, the acting was particularly nice, I thought, and, um, so, it was quite popular.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, you don't play, um, an instrument so, uh, um, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or Yeah, yeah. That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, you know, some other kind of instrument, I think piano is always good background,|sd qy aa aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|beginner. Um, I played piano all through, well, I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college, and, uh, then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school, so, um, that was the instrument both of my children started on, but neither of them stayed with it|% sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|One of them, um, turned into a violist, and the other one is, the boy is, um, guitar and, and percussion, so.|sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but the, I, I think that the piano background is very, um, useful, and, um, I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on.|% sv sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh. Do you have any other kind of music that you like?|b qy
B|Um, oh, I like to listen to all different kinds of music.|sd
A|Uh-huh. I have a, I used to work with a fellow who had, um, although this was a computer company, he had his, uh, P H D in musical, uh, I guess it was in composition, actually, from University of North Texas, and, uh, yet when I would go into his, his office every now and then, you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio It may be country, it might be classical, it might be rock, you know|b % sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.|sd

B|There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like but,|sd %

B|um|%
A|I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing, I'm not sure where, you are in Texas, but I do know that some communities have, uh, community choruses and, uh, that's often a good way to get back into it again.|sd sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's not terribly demanding. You might have to audition, but that probably wouldn't be a problem, but, um, there usually, you know, that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know, people socially as well as, as in a musical setting,|sv sd sv sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that's always fun.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's, well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music, but we've gotten to know each other quite well, um, in, on a, a social level, and, and I think we sing better because of that.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think, you know, I think we sing more like, uh, people who trust each other which is really nice.|sd
B|That's good. Uh-huh, yeah.|ba b b
A|So, whereabouts in, Texas are you, if I could ask?|qw

B|Yeah, I think so.|ny sd
A|Yeah, yeah. That often is the case, um, the, you know, it's, it, sometimes it will skip. Like my husband is not musical at all, but his mother is very musical, and, um, and his children are very musical, so you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.
