A|Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution. I think Grand Rapids was number one. Uh, we really don't have too much of a problem as far as, uh, industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here. But we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain. coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Right. Well, that's true. Actually down here we don't have a big problem with, uh, with air pollution. Mainly because we don't have anybody to to either side of us. Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes. I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in, uh, you know, debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution and their attitude's, basically, well, prevailing ins, winds are to the east so why should we have to worry.|b aa sd sv sd sd sd sd ^q
A|Yeah. I've, I've, uh, was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes. I mean you couldn't really see that much Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions|b sd sd sv sd
B|Oh, yes nothing,|b %
A|and then it gets hazy around here but they're really, we don't have a big problem with it. I think that, uh, what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is, it's, it's the, uh, ongoing acid rain problem. Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas where, you know, the lakes are becoming, uh, changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.|sd % sd sv sd sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I know that there's been battles over the states up here. Uh, you know, Governor Mario going after, you know, governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there. I remember when I was in Florida, the only problem was that it seemed like it may, it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh absolutely, yeah, just muggy. So, yes I think, yeah, I think you're right. Our most pollute substance down here is just water. But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place.|aa aa sv aa % aa sv sv sv
A|Yeah it,|b %
B|You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around.|sv sd
A|Oh, yeah. I, you know, I was in Boston once and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee. Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing|b sd sd sd
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go. I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is, I think that's biggest problem because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.|sv sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really. Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything.|sd sv sd
B|That's, that's very true. Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere. But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry, you've got that, and you got the cars. I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean.|aa sv sd sd sd sv
A|Yeah. I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami, but I, I, uh, you know, Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh, but, you know, up here we have Kodak|b sv % sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and that's the worst polluter. They put, uh, uh, you can smell ether in the air sometimes It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.|sv % sd sv
B|I guess so.|aa
A|Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras and they, they make film here and they're the worst offender but it's, you know, it's under so much control. You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them but that's really getting under control now.|sd sd sv sv sd sv
B|Right. I, you know, I don't know in air what they do. Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about. Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh, my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air. I, but I don't know how, uh, you know, there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad.|b sd sd % sd sd sv sd sv
