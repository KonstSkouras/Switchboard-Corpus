B|Right.|b
A|You know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way. It is certainly has affected, uh, U S policy though. There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.|aa sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq. I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one.|sv sv
A|Right. The devastation, yeah.|aa ba aa
B|Yeah. The only difference was that the government said, okay if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent. And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.|b^m sv ^q ^q
