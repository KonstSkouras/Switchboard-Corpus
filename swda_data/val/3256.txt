B|Yeah, I, I agree with you, although I will say, I'm not sure, you know, I sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have, you know, was, was because they were abused abused as children. And the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute, we didn't do anything like that you know,|aa aa h sd sv ^q

A|Is that the new, I just happened to see the headline on it, and I didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what, but I thought, uh, you know, if these things, if children are being abused, I, I'm wondering how our school system is failing, that they're not even seeing this, you know, if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults, that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way, that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger, and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, to, to deal with that yet, but still.|% sd sd sd sv sd %

B|Yeah, I, I think that's, I, you know, uh, killing a child, or kidnapping, uh, and possibly not, well, I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt, you know, if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty,|aa % % % sv sv
