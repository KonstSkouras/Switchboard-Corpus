A|There we go.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah. Well, uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year.|b sv
A|I think that's true. The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March, and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April. So. So I think we're a little ahead of schedule on that.|aa sd sd sv
B|Yeah. Yeah, I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon, and I noticed all that grass coming up, and I thought, ooh, we've got to start this mowing bit soon|b b sd sd sd ^q
A|That's true. It's been a, a fun break, but the break is over.|aa sd sd
B|Yeah. Well, um, oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,|b sv
A|Yeah, now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.|b sd
B|Yeah. But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray|b sd
A|Well, yeah, but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend.|b sv
B|Oh, I go for that, yeah.|aa aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here. We have a long weekend and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah. I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not.|b sd
B|I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening, but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain.|sd sd sd
A|Well, that's good.|ba
B|But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties. That's getting back to a little bit chillier.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year. I think, I haven't seen the the weather on the news in the evening lately, but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy.|b sv % sd sd
B|Yeah. I'm not certain either, but you're probably right.|b sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there. I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm. I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, that's true. Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.|aa aa sd
B|Um.|b
A|And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.|sv
B|Yeah. You're probably right.|aa aap_am
A|I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.|sd
B|Yes, as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago|b sd %
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know|sd
A|Right.|b
B|it wasn't just a super bad storm, but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time.|sd sd
A|Right. Yeah. One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.|b b sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead, and it was six degrees out.|sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature.|sd
B|Yeah, that, that is pretty unusual. And you really take notice of it, too.|aa sd sd
A|That's right. It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high. Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing. The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees.|aa sv sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away.|sd
B|Wow. I don't, don't like that super cold stuff.|ba sd
A|Nope.|aa
B|I just don't move very well when it's that cold.|sd
A|Yep, I, I'm really enjoying this now. Well, this has been interesting.|aa sd sv
B|Yeah, well.|aa
A|Not too challenging to the brain.|sv
B|Not, not a real in depth topic, but enjoyed talking to you.|sv
A|Nope. All right, Ellen, well you have a good day.|aa fo_o_fw_"_by_bc fc
