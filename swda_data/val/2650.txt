B|You know, I know sometimes our cat will, will stay out all night, and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then I really get scared.

A|Is that right?|bh
B|He's, cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are. They just really do not want other animals on their property. They're very, very he, he just any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything, but he'll sit and he'll watch, and, I think maybe he would if it came real close, but he's very protective of our property.|% sd sd % % sd sd sd sd sd

A|so, you know, I never really had them around me, you know, so I've never owned one you know, since I,|sd sd
B|Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're very independent, and they're very, he's very affectionate when he wants to be, but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be, he'll just, he'll, you know either scratch you or run away.|sd sd sd
