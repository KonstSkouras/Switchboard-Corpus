A|So, how do you feel about our policy in Latin America?|qo
B|Oh, I'm all in favor of it, yeah No, I, uh, I think we've been doing a pretty good job, you know, not, uh, not taking advantage of our, you know, of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us, you know, uh, I mean we could direct the government even more than we have been. I don't think we've been doing too bad.|sd % ar sv sv sv
A|Yeah. Well, do you think that's, do you think that's right? Do you think, we should direct the government?|b qy qy
B|Um. Well, I think that, uh, as a whole that the, being that the drug problem, the drug industry can, uh, bring so much money to a country. I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the the drug, uh, cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America.|% sv sv
A|Yeah|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he, he was all for it because it's just like you say, uh, there's so many people there that, that get the kind of control that's bad, you know,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like, well, you know, I use to feel like, well, they, they, should work their way, you know, they should, should be able to work their self out of it or, you know, why, why, why intervene in another country's, you know, problems and things like that. Why, why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that but I think just a lot of times if we don't then, then it, then that influence will affect our country too for one. And for two, you know, that it does help. I mean, you know, I think the people in those country do want our help.

I mean I'd rather, even if a country chooses a government that's not, you know, exactly the kind of government that we have, you know or, or as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, as long, as long it's one that's, that, that makes since, so to speak, you know, it is a government that stays in power, that can stay in power, but it seems like most of them don't you know.|sd % sv sv sv
B|Yeah. Well, sometimes that's, that's America doing that too you know,|b sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b

B|I'm, I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not, because on one hand you have, you know, that the, you know, the, Soviet Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, uh, Slovak countries and then, on the other hand, you have, well,|sd sv

A|See, I, I agree with that. Yeah,|aa b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I agree that, that the communication that now, that communication has, become so much more widespread and, you know, worldwide that people are realizing hey, we don't have it so good and let's stand up|sv
B|Right.|b
A|you know, uh, this is ridiculous we're living, with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that, uh, I think people are just saying, no way, we don't want anywhere of this.|% sv
B|Yeah. I think, uh, Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive, you know, where it's always the minority that are, are trying to make the country better.|b sv
A|Yeah Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't mean to, well, I guess I do in a way, sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that. I think that, that, uh, because of those countries a lot, you know, where such Catholic influence. And I think the Catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak,|b b % sd sv sv sv
B|I thought, it was the other way around.|sd
A|but,|%
B|They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this, so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it, it's been, sort of like, you know.|sv sv
A|Uh. But, but see, but I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion, as far as through the ages has been the rule, so to speak. You know, they are the ones that set, that set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down, I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're, yet they're expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, you know.|% sv sv sv sv
B|I don't quite understand that. Do they even understand what's being said?|sd qy
A|Well, when, when it use to be Latin. I'm just saying, that, the old church.|no sv
B|Oh, yeah, the old church. Yeah.|bk ^2 b
A|Yeah. Which it's not that way now but I think that there is, just that, I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around.|b sd sv
B|Well, they actually understood, it is in America where it was hard Latin, you know is very, very, very close to Spanish.|sd sd sd
A|Well, Latin, Uh, they still didn't understand it though, I don't think,|arp_nd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|because I, I descend from that. And I, you know, I don't, can't, I don't understand Latin|sd sd
B|Uh. Yeah.|b
A|and I'm of Spanish descent. So um, I, I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or, tend to be, you know, the the more meek, you know, they tend to be more, like not stand up for their rights as much. They're not really sure of what they are. I don't think.|sd sv sv sv sv
B|Uh, I never really thought of, it that way.|sd
A|Well, I mean, how, can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in Latin America. I mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal or why do they not, you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights?|qh qh qh
B|I don't know, could be the, the economic still. You know, the, there's, the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the Latin American countries. I mean, you can say that about Africa too. I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic, uh, country,|sd sv % % sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and yet, you know, they have the same problem where, you know, where kings and such,|sv
A|Uh, I don't, agree with that. I don't agree, because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in, in, uh, Africa. I think they've made a lot more chances. They, they've, their very vocal.|ar ar sv sv sv
B|Well, in South Africa, yeah In South Africa I think they are, but yet, you know,|% aa sv %
A|So, what's the difference?|qw
B|Idi Amin was, you know, in power for so long.|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah. *b|b
B|Uh, racial, I think or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other English colonies, or previous English colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not, you know, I think communication does have a lot to do with it, you know, in education, maybe.|sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there. So, I think it is communication, it's just oopsy.|h sd sv sv
A|I think it maybe has to do with a a lot to do with education because you look at the, uh, European countries, I think they tend to be more educated, much more, educated than, than Africa or the Latin American countries.|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, that's true. You know that, I don't know whether, uh, actually I, I've always wondered whether, how the education system works in the Russian countries, the Republics, you know.|b aa aa % h qw^d

B|Really. That's good, in a way You know, uh, something we compete with.|b sv sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Uh, and I've been sort of disappointed how that they, they say literacy rate has gone down, you know, that's sort of upsetting, to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer|sd sd
A|Yeah. In our country?|b br
B|In our country, yeah,|aa aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|that is really upsetting and, and, considering it's free, you know, I mean good education is really still free.|sd sd sv
A|Yeah. Well, that's just it though, good education.|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Is it good education? It may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it, you know,|qh qh fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qh
B|Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. *b|b b
A|I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but, so are they willing to, pay for, you know quality education, you know? So, you know, and yet they, yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology, you know, that we use to dominate and it's like well, you know, they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do. So, you're going to have to expect it. So what you, are you willing to compromise a little and, and pay, pay some, take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education.
