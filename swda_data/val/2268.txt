A|what kind of fishing do you enjoy?|qw
B|Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing.|sd
A|So, you like fresh water.|qy^d
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing because you get, I get sea sick|ny ny sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh I see|b b
B|Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine, so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing. Now, that would be nice.|sd sd sv
A|Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|and anything that was fresh water was muddy|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh I bet it is.|b ba
A|There's so many different ways to catch fish.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that. Which isn't technically fishing, but it's a lot of fun.|sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I, I grew up fishing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What area of lakes do you like?|qw
B|Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,|^h
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there. But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing. I can't remember what the name of the lake is, and he was just here this past weekend. I could have, I, I think he mentioned it again, but I couldn't remember what it was. Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork. I, I can't remember, but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.|sd sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd

B|Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and he said that he has never gone anywhere before, and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen. So I would love to go over there. They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring, and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass.|b b b sd sd sd sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|What's the largest fish you ever caught?|qw
B|Uh, gosh, I think it was only like three and a half pounds, and for me that's big. That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big. Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh, I know they have bigger fish than that but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,|ba sd sd sd sd sd sd
