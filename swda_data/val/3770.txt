A|Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, um, the care of the elderly.|qy^d
B|Yes, I have. In fact, uh, just a little over, just a little less than a year ago, uh, my mother went to be with the Lord, and we cared for her the last, oh, seventeen months of her life here in the, at home. Aside from, uh, having to, uh, take her to the hospital|ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, you know, those times, well, she was there in the, the regular hospital.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer, and so the doctor elected to have her, uh, finish out, uh, in the hospice program.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing home, because, uh, she's around her own you know, the, the elderly parent in question is around their own family. The, uh, hospice program provides a hospital type bed. Well, it is a hospital bed, and all the oxygen, stuff and a, uh, and a visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.|sd sd
A|Well, that's nice.|ba
B|And it's all taken care of by, by, uh, Medicare, uh, and, uh, it, it's, it's really neat, uh. And I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't banish, uh, my old loved one to a, to a warehouse.|sd ba sd
A|No.|aa
B|And that's, that's what I basically, uh, view a nursing home as, a warehouse, so that's,|sv %
A|It's really sad|sv
B|Pardon me?|br
A|It's really a sad situation.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|And, uh, I think a lot of people struggle with. I,  I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, you know, the parent is,  doesn't always want the in-law living in the house.|sv sv
B|Oh . Uh-huh.|b b
A|Is that right?|qy
B|Right.|na
A|Well, that's really sad.|ba
B|Yeah, I know. But, uh, in this case, uh, spouse and I, uh, are, uh, we're, are, are, uh, united in this area because,  I guess her father, her grandfather and grandmother both lived with, uh, her parents, uh, their golden years too,|aa aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so this isn't like, uh, uh, just one, one, uh, instance.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|In fact, uh, her, uh, uh, experiences were, were invaluable to me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, in fact, I don't know if I could have, uh, held up, uh, you know, without my wife, uh, helping in this,  this, in this case.|sd
A|Right. Yes. Well, I know when the, I remember being a child and my grandmother had had several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents tried to keep her in the house, and they did for a long time. I couldn't,  tell you how long, until she got, uh, where she had to have complete care,|b b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so ,  they couldn't, you know, keep her in the house anymore,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was really hard on everyone. She had to have, you know, twenty-four hour a day care. And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And that, um, they put her there, and we all went just constantly until she died.|sd sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|But it was very hard on everyone to see, you know, grandmother be like that, and I don't know that, you know, I don't, being so young, I don't remember why. You know, what was, why she had to go there.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, maybe, well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it.|b sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way.|b sd
B|Oh, boy, yeah.|ba %
A|And that that, they couldn't, they found that they could not you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, then, then there's almost, then there's almost no, no, uh, uh, choice left to her then|b b sv
A|No, but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, you know,  in the nursing home.|aa aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do remember the other patients there, uh, being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone.|sd
B|Right. In fact, just, uh, just, uh, sit and chat with them for five minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh. Right, right. And I guess that's hard on people to give, give up their lives. If they're busy they don't you know.|b aa aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, I guess.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|If you can afford them. But, anyway. Well, I'm,  glad it worked out good for your family.|sv sd
B|And then, then, Oh, yeah, it did, and I was just I just praised the Lord that, that we were able to, uh, have, uh, uh,|% b sd sd
