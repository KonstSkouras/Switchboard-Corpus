A|It is. I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He is one of the best actors I've ever seen. It's, there's a point where, the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that, this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less, but it wears off.|sv % % sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh, it starts off with like a tic,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all. And it was just so realistic. The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. What does, uh, is Robby, Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it?|b qw % qy

B|I didn't read, see the, the movie, I read the book but I,|no sd %
A|I did too. That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part|sd sd
B|Yeah, in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so.|b sd %
A|Yeah, right.|b b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well what have you seen?|qw

B|It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice, but each was about half an hour long, so.|sd ^q %
A|Where did you cry.|qw^d
B|Um, let's see, when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.|^h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.|sd
A|Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.|b b b
B|And, uh, I think from there on, all the way through the movie. Let's see what else did it. Um, what other parts. I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.|sd ^h sd
A|I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed|sd
B|I don't remember when the horse got killed.|sd
A|Oh, when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.|% sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can tell I'm an animal lover, you can hear my dog|sv sv
B|Unfortunately we don't have any animals, so, uh.|sd %
A|Yeah. It was a beautiful story, it really was.|b sv sv
B|It, there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.|% sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|What did you think about the buffalo scenes.|qw^d
A|Oh, I thought it was awful, and so graphic,|sv
B|That was, Yeah.|aa b
A|I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know. I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.|sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie.|sd
B|Oh, oh.|b
A|Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.|sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah, it's not,|b b %
A|But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.|sd
B|Uh-huh, well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.|b sd
A|No it wasn't|aa sd
B|Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful, like that was great.|sv sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|And there were so many of them. I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.|sd sd
A|Yeah, really.|b b
B|So that was pretty.|sv
A|And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.|sv
B|I wonder how they kept up with them, though, it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.|sd sd
A|I know.|aa
B|I guess they graze, though, that wouldn't be a problem.|sd sv
A|Yeah, yeah. Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.|b b qy^d
B|No, huh-uh.|nn nn
A|It was, they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.|% sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and, uh, they had to teach a wolf how to, to howl.|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves|sd
B|I guess they're just not domesticated, or, or,|sv %
A|Yeah, what, they just don't howl that much anymore. I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do Yeah.|b % sv sd sd b
B|Well that's funny.|ba
A|Well, I think we've made it.|sv
B|Oh is that five minutes, is that,|qy^d %
