A|Well, uh, and that's an idea that's been around for, kicked around for a long time. I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered, uh, as far as close to passing, uh, any legislation or anything like that. But, uh, I believe Israel does that, don't they for their,|sd sd sv
B|Uh, yes, I think so. Uh,|aa aa
A|everybody has to do, has to do something.|sv
B|Yeah, I don't|b h
A|Or maybe, maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone. But, uh,|sd %
B|Yeah, I believe that's right.|aa aa
A|Okay.|b
B|And, uh, and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about.|sv
A|No, I don't think it's, it's I think of that. It, it couldn't be. Military service is not that much but, the, military used to do it but the idea that, uh, there are things that, that do need to be done that could be done and then, uh, country would benefit from one year from, from everybody and even out the, the, uh, requirement.|aa sv sv sv sv sv sv sv
B|Yeah, for, for kids in high school, it could be in the summertime.|aa sv
A|Well, now that's a thought. Yeah.|ba %
B|Uh, you know, um, it, it could even be done while they're doing another job, while they're doing, you know, a job to make money.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, it's, uh, you know, such a grassroots idea that it, I think the family would have to be involved in it.|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And people would have to be convinced that, you know, I, I think the, the basic message is that giving is better than receiving|sv sv
A|Yeah, right.|aa aa
B|And that's not the kind of society we have right now.|sv
A|Oh, yeah, I'm afraid you're right there. But, uh, but, uh, anything like this that came up whether it, it quickly would be significant industry in, in figuring out how to get around it where people,|aa aa % sv
B|There's lots and lots of volunteer programs and, uh, but most of those are at least it, it's my opinion that most of those involve adults. Adults who have the time to give and, and, uh, you know, the desire to, to give.|sv sv
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b b b
B|It's not, uh, you know it's not, uh, maybe the, maybe it uh, younger people feel like it's not open to them, I don't know. But it should be if it's not.|% % sv h sv
A|Yeah. Uh, I suspect that yeah, that, that, that that's not the thing. That they, that they don't feel it's open to them it's just that they, uh, are more self-centered if you will and not, not considering, a voluntary ,|b ar sv
B|Yeah, it is kind of an introspective time of life.|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But some schools, some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to, uh, you know, areas economically, uh say less advantaged areas.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And, uh, they, they promote service on the part of the kids to, to, uh, some of those people. So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess.|sd sv
A|Yeah. yeah. And, uh, now I I don't know it I, I think you're right that that's not the, not the way that the society these days is going, and I, I think we need to, we need to try to figure out some way to, to turn that around that everybody,|aa aa % aa sv
B|It's really, it's really unfortunate because when you do, I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association.|sv sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And I have, have done, uh, gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society. And there's, there's no question that doing, you know, doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than, uh, than the people involved.|sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself and, and that's, I think that's a really important lesson to learn.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not, uh, not really happy, you know.|sv
A|Well, that could be.|aap_am
B|Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, you know|sv
A|Yeah, right.|aa aa
B|Uh, it really is better to give then to receive.|sv
A|Yeah, I, I agree with that, and, uh, and I, I, I don't know what, what has, what has set it off or what but it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,|aa aa sd sv
