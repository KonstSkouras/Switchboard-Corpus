B|Uh, basically I'm at home and I have two cats and my husband,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean my husband's great.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|It's wonderful,  you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever,|sd
A|Uh-huh Around there, huh.|b ^2
B|So, yeah.|aa
A|Well, you're, you're just a youngster then|sd
B|Yeah, I'm just a spring chicken, I guess|b sd
A|I passed the fifty. So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles, so it should be real interesting.|sd sd sv
B|Well, Righto|% b
A|So, you think we're ready?|qy
B|I think I'm ready|na
A|Okay okay. Uh, you want to start off?|bk bk ad
B|Well, let's see, the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh, since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby uh,|aa ^h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change.|sv
A|Very much, yeah, yeah.|aa b
B|Very much, and I think you'll have to agree and and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties,|aa sv sd
A|Yes. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical, it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.|sv sd
A|I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, they come in that way.|sv
B|And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's okay and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much. So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,|sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then the women change around them.|sv
A|I hadn't thought much about that, but that is true. That,|sd ba %
B|Uh, I think men are trying.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Some of them.|b sv
B|But they don't have a national organization of men,  to, uh, help them out|sv
A|No.|b
B|and uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,  where both team, it has to be a team partnership now,|sv
A|Very much. Uh-huh.|ba b
B|and they both have to work|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they both have to raise the children,  if we're going to have any kind of future at all,|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, the me, oh, I don't know, the, the yuppiedom,  the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers|% h sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they wanted to compete with men, they wanted to be like men,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's wrong.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men|sv
A|Not, no, they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.|% b sv
B|Absolutely, and so that's, you know, they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,  that they've had to, you know, restructure,|aa % sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day, I got to get some for all my men friends, it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do|sd sd sd
A|There you go There's a lot of truth in that.|ba ba
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, we shouldn't, we were made differently,  however you come to that conclusion, we were biologically, physiologically, made differently and there is great wonderment,  in that, and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other so,|% sd sv sv sv %
A|Yes, it shouldn't be destroyed.|aa sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|And, and, you know, just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing,|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|it's, it's viva la difference  someone said that|sv
A|Yeah, yeah. Yeah.|b b b
B|and I think that you can truly respect the other person, I mean, you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know you know. Depends,|sv sv %
A|Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. You know.|sv
B|Yeah. Well that depends on what day of the month it is.|b sd
A|Yeah|b
B|But, uh, I don't know, I guess we've gotten more of a, in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles,|h sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles and,|sd %
A|I think now when both are working they have a more more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.|sv
B|Yeah, well, that's, that's a very different way to do,|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,  raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,|sv
A|Right. Right. Yeah. Because you get set in your ways and it's,  really hard because to, to really to get help. Uh, you know to get the work load shared.|b b b sv sv
B|Are, are you married?|qy
A|Yes, uh-huh. Our,|ny ny %
B|Do you have children?|qy
A|I, we have five children, they're They're all grown and on their own|na sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|so,|%
B|Oh, my.|ba
A|They're, uh,|%
B|How did you do?|qo
A|Uh, how do you mean that?|qo
B|Well, I mean, okay, well did you have boys, girls, how did, how,|sd qo % %
A|Uh, we have, uh, two girls and three boys and our,  our baby girl just had a baby girl|sd sd
B|Oh, my. Oh, my.|ba ba
A|Last week was her first baby.|sd
B|Oh, how exiting.|ba
A|So it's been real exciting.|ba
B|I, I tell you what. I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids.|ba sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I just love the babies|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that, it's,|sd
A|Yeah. Have you been that way long?|b qy
B|Just eight years, just|ng %
A|Just eight years.|b^m
B|the most important years of my life you know|sd
A|That's, that's a long eight years, though.|sv
B|Yeah, it has been.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but that's another story.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps, I mean I, I couldn't ask for a better life.|sd sd
A|That makes a big difference. Uh-huh.|sv b
B|I mean if this is the way it had to be,  this is the best way,  I could possibly do it|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and, and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things that really,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort,  of thing|sd
A|Yes.|aa
B|and,|%
A|Well, probably your role and, and the way you are also has changed, though. You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.|sv sv
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. I mean, boy, I mean I, I would have had so, I had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place, you know,  where I couldn't do a lot of things and, uh, just adjusting to that,  that, uh, yeah, that was a major change,|ba b ba ba sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b b b
B|but so, I guess uh, in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can, but but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,|sv sv
A|The best you can, yeah.|b^m
B|they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there, I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.|sv sv
A|I, yeah, that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and security. That, I think that's being damaged, uh,  a lot.|% b sd % sv
B|I think,  we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, uh, oh, not very nurturing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think,|%
A|I do, too. I, I think, uh, now some, some women can, can do both. They're very capable of working and, and,|aa % sv sv %
B|Yeah, but I wish they weren't so many, I, I wish they weren't role models for everybody,  because it's so dangerous.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. It, it really is, yeah.|b aa
B|It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that and then when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,  you know, her life sort of falls apart|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she doesn't know who she is and she's,|sv %
A|So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|or they say they do anyways, and, but I think ones that don't have to, the, it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.|sd sv sv
B|Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.|sv
A|Well, that could be.|ba
B|Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south you know, a woman's role is,  a woman's role,  sort of thing,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah.|b b % b b
B|and you know,|%
A|You mean it's stronger there?|qy
B|Uh, oh, yeah, yeah.|ny ny
A|Much stronger.|ba
B|And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,  with the good old boys,  here in Texas sort of thing,  making career moves|sv
A|Yeah. Right. Right.|b b b
B|but, Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years. I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.|sv
A|Right. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.|b b b b
B|That's the woman's role,|sv
A|Yes.|ba
B|and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes, but then I'm not there, so I don't know that.|sv h h
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|And I have women that do both and I see a little jealousy on the part of, you know, the woman what has two little boys and, and she has an au pair, which is a live-in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the back|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh.|%
B|and then my other girlfriend that has, you know, just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy,  all the time.|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|And so I see I little bit of that and I always wish there was a balance, you know,  with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge,  for a while|sd
A|Right. But they're both,|b sd
B|Get some peace and quiet.|^2
A|Yeah, they're both different people, too. That's, That's where the trouble lies.|aa sd sv
B|Yeah, definitely, so. You're right about that. Yeah.|b ba aa b
A|Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,|sv
B|And that's,|%
A|and others can't.|sv
B|That's true. That's so true. How, how did your daughter do it?|ba ba qo
A|Uh, well, uh, I have one daughter that works full-time. She has two little boys.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, they seem to do fine. She has been has talked about quitting, you know, and staying home for a few years. But then, it's real hard because she's got an excellent job.|sd sd sd
