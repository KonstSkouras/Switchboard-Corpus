A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed, so  he's an indoor cat,|sd sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.|sv
A|Yeah, well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,|b sd

A|Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house|sd
B|Is that the only pet that you have?|qy
