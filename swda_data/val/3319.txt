A|I usually play a couple of times a month. Sometimes more, but lately it's been just about that. But, I do enjoy, I think the, one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses.|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Yes, and, the, the peacefulness.|aa ^2
A|Uh-huh. You can get out there,|aa sd
B|And the little critters that are around.|^2
A|Yeah, that's really neat. You can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there.|b sd sv
B|That's right and it's such a personal challenge.|aa ^2
A|Uh-huh, yeah, it really is.|aa aa aa
B|More than competitiveness against someone else. It's, it's a competitiveness against yourself.|sv sv
A|And, you know, it's so frustrating, I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating. You think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot better, you know, and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's just terrible.|sd qh sd sd sd sd
B|Well, you'll,|%

A|Uh-huh. Well, I've only been playing like about three years now. My husband's played for twenty-five. But, I just took it up about three years ago and, uh, we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments. We belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas,|b sd sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh. That's right. And you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it|b aa sv

A|Really?|bh
B|And, uh, now that was very competitive.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|And, I enjoyed it tremendously, but, uh, I, I'm more, I think I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And if, if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green, so be it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be better|sd
A|Yeah, I have never played in any tournament except just a scramble. They have a lot of them there at the club, you know, they have A B C D type tournaments and then they, they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well, but, I don't know, I've just never really gotten into that. Now, my husband and all the men, I mean, they love the real competitiveness of playing for money, you know.|b sd sd sd sd h sd sd

A|Uh-huh. But I, I'm not good enough for that|b sd
B|Does your club have a good woman's association?|qy
A|Yes, they do. I don't do much with it since, uh, most of theirs, they have a traveling league, and, uh, most of their meetings and all are during the week and I don't, don't get to play except on the weekend. I work during the week all the time.|ny sd sd sd sd sd sd
