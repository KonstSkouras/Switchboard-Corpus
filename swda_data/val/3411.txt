B|And course the top, now the what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty.|sv
A|Yeah, and, uh, the, I, I've never really, uh, I've never ridden in one recently, um, but they're supposed to be just real smooth.|aa % sd sv

B|they look like they're very sturdy, and you don't have to worry that much about, um, getting, you know, hurt like you would in a small one.|sv sv
A|Right. Now they've got a unique uh, feature in them now. If, uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside. It'll go underneath the car instead.|aa sd sd sd

A|Oh, that's great|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's great. That's always nice to get, uh, reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending, you know, anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for, for a single item. You know,|ba sv
B|Right.|b
A|you just don't want any hassles with it.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|You just, you expect it to do its, its job, and I think a lot of, a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into don't take that into consideration you know.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah, that's true.|b aa aa
A|They just expect you to buy their product, but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be you know.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Price is, is an issue, but it's not the most important issue.|sv sv
B|No, it really isn't, because now you can get like five year financing on them and so, um,|aa sv %
