B|Yeah. I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh, it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans and, uh, yeah, I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.|b sv sv % sd
A|Yeah. Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one, or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.|b sd % sv
B|Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.|sv
A|Right. Yeah. Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps. I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,|aa aa sv sv
B|Yeah, I agree. Uh, as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there, and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro|aa aa sd sd

A|Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to, to see, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually. It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.|sd sv
B|Yeah, that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about. I agree. You know like you say we're used to finite things and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.|aa aa aa aa sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, me too. I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.|b b sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.|sv
A|Huh. I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.|b sv

B|Yeah, I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much. I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing. You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon, you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.|aa sv sv % sv sv sv
