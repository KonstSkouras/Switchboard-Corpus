A|Okay. Uh, let me see I've been sitting here awhile. I almost forgot the topic. But, uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television. I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc ^h sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well I get a, weekend paper as well and, uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly. I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee|b b sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local stuff uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then I get the Sunday, uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper. Uh, mostly  that's my difficulty.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which  has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Are you in the car quite a bit or,|b b qy %
B|No, I'm not actually. Uh, but I can run my radio in my office. I, I  teach at the university|nn sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh. Oh, I see. Uh,|b bk
B|How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?|qy
A|Yeah. I, I, I pretty much am and I watch the news at least twice a day.|ny sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens, you know.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was the explosions and that kind of thing. My husband will say how did you know about that. Yes, it happened at such and such time And that's so, that, that's different for me. So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.|sd sd ^q ^q sd sd
B|Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely noting of the events as they happen? Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?|qy qy
A|Uh, no it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know. It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred|nn sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it happened and,|sd %
B|Well, I, myself, uh, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.|sd
A|Right, right.|b b
B|The local doesn't either but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And perhaps newspapers do that but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when I have read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.|sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Huh.|b b
B|So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too. Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it. But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.|sv qh sd sv
A|Right. Right. It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.|aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That kind of thing.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|So. Uh,|%
B|I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world  rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture. Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail. I don't know|sd sd h
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah.|b b sd %
B|So.|%
A|But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's and if I miss them, I try you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing, I try and tape them and so I can sit back and watch them. And it's pretty interesting.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|When, you have young children, right?|% qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.|qy^d
A|Well, yeah. Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things|ny sd
B|Oh, you do? Uh-huh.|bh b
A|If I don't want any interruptions, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That kind of thing.|h
B|When is your good watching time?|qw
A|Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah, that's what,|b b b %
A|Unfortunately, but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.|sd sd
B|I have older children and getting dinner on the table.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|I come from the east coast and I was, it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,|sd % sd
