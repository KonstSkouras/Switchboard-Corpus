A|Okay. Uh it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff. So it's, it may be an idea to think about, you know, cost. Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as, uh, they may say they're not biased,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but deep down they are against this person or whatever, so, uh, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about. So,|sv sv %
B|Right, that it, that it, I, a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not and, and, uh, not depend so much on the, on the emotions of a particular case, but be able to put it in overall perspective.|b % % sv
A|Exactly. Uh-huh.|ba b
B|Well I, I certainly haven't thought much about this|sd
A|Yeah.|b

A|Catches you off guard, doesn't it?|qy
B|Yes, yes, some of them, some of them do and some of them don't, but, uh, this one, uh, I was trying to remember back. It seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much.|ny ny sv sv % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state.|sd
A|I didn't think they were either. I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty.|sv
B|Yeah. And, uh, I, I guess, and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh, that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever.|b % sd
A|Changes. Uh-huh.|^2 b
B|I, yeah, but, I, yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that. I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased.|% b sd sv
A|Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.|ba b b
B|Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system. That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever.|sv sv
A|Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.|ba ba b b b
B|But, uh, and, and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a, just a bare majority.|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|Uh-huh, yeah. That's kind of how I, you know, in certain cases I can see them going, uh, uh, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, uh, burglary or whatever|b b sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized. But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever.|sd sd sv
B|Yeah, whatever. Yeah.|b ^2 b
A|Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what. I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, also there's aspect of cost and I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, uh, the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what. You know, being that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know. But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay.|sv sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, whether it's, I think it's with pay. If I remember, jury duty is with pay.|% sd sd
B|Well, And, and I'm, I, I'd, I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work. But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid.|% % % % sd sv
A|Paid, right.|^2
B|Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company. But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,|sv sv
