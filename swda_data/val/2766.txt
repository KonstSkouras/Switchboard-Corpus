A|Are you ready?|qy
B|I guess so.|na
A|The Middle East Crisis should we be there?|qy
B|Oh, dear that's a hard one. That's really hard for me because, uh, you know, I really, I have a son that's sixteen and I think, you know, eventually, you know, he'll be of, of drafting age. And I think gosh, do I want him to go and yet I'm proud to be an American and I know that we have a country that, you know, people would give anything to live in, a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have. And yet, I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for, for this country and yet, and yet, I know that I, that, and I, I, when I was in school it was always the tired, the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore. I mean, not sure that communism is, is as strong as it once was. And I'm not sure that, that that's the reason why we're, like we were in Vietnam supposedly so.|^h sd sd sd sd sv sd h sd sv sv
A|Well, you realize why we were in the Middle East. Why we invaded Iraq, why we were in Saudi, why we attacked Kuwait and we we're, why we are still fighting Iraq.|qy^d

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Kuwait was the nonaggressor|sd

A|What did we lose,  forty-one Americans,   lives.|qh
B|and we won. Yeah, and that, that's wonderful but what if, if that wasn't the case. What if we would have lost thousands of young men. Would that, would it have been too much of a price to pay for that? I don't know. See, and I think there are a lot of things that we don't know but,  that,|sd b sv qh qh qh sd sv %
A|Oh, of course, our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.|b sv
B|the American people, Oh, sure. Well, and there's a lot,  that we,|% aa sv
A|And that's,  our own fault because we elected them.|sv
B|Yeah. I think that's true but I think there's a lot that we, the public doesn't need to know. I think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national security sake. And I, you know, I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I don't, I don't think people could handle it. So I think there are things that we should not know, the masses shouldn't know but I also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too.|aa sv sv sv sv sv sd

B|See, and I don't know, I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it. I mean I thought the war was going to go on and on. I really was surprised when it ended so quickly and,|sd sv sd %
A|Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years, the last three years of Vietnam.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.|sv
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|And it's not their job to fight for their own land.|sv
B|Yeah, that is very it's very strange. Uh, and yet, you know, see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans, their culture is so much different than ours, you know, I've heard from many people that we could not even begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours and, um, they just don't think the same way we do. Their culture is completely different and almost opposite.|b sv sv sd sd sv sv
A|And really from all I can from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.|sv
