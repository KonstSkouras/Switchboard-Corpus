B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them. So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.|sd sd sd sv
B|I would think so. When you, when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working? Did you work or were you able to stay at home with him?|aa % qy qy qrr

A|Yeah. Oh yeah. Well I am sure it was, you know. But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids. Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.|b aa sv sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, it's really rough. Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days, but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they will be married nine years this year. So, I don't know. She's a nurse, you know and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids, so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.|sd h sd sd sd
B|Yeah, that's a possibility.|aa sv
A|You know. But, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc %
B|Well, We really want to have a family. We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself and  you should, you should be sharing your family.
