A|Hi, good morning.|fp fp
B|Good morning.|fp
A|Do you have recycling in Sachse?|qy
B|Yes, we do. We've  got, uh, a pickup twice a week that they come out|ny sd sd
A|Do,|%
B|and, they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it.|sd sd
A|Oh really?|bh
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's twice a week?|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Really? We have, recently started, uh, a bin program here in Plano where, uh, used to be we, we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up. And now they have, uh, these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there. And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet, but they're, but they're planning on doing it very soon. Apparently the trucks that they had, um, lined up, they needed the parts for, Saudi Arabia|bh sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And so that put off the program for a while. But, uh, do you recycle?|sd qy
B|Um, my kids do|na
A|Do they? Uh-huh.|bh b
B|Put it that way. They, they've been recycling cans for extra money.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|So that's, that's been their summer money and they're fixing to go to Disneyland. So,|sd sd %
A|Oh, well|%
B|So,|%
A|that's great.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Well that's the way we started too. My daughter was going, to Camp Goddard, um, which is through the Plano school system, you know in the fall  couple of years ago|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to baby-sit. So, that's how she started. She started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and, uh, aluminum cans and plastics.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh|ny ny
B|Is, is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they, weigh it or whatever and,|bf qy %
A|No, the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans.|nn sd
B|Um.|%
A|Um, the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling. And so, you know, we don't get paid for that but that's okay.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, it's, it's not that much of a bother really. You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of, two liter bottles. Um, and like milk cartons and things like that. It's amazing how much plastic you generate.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, I was amazed at how many cans  that we got|b sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|because when the kids first went down, I said, that, you know that's great and I was thinking, you know maybe I'd help supplement it, you know when they turned them in|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's amazing how many cans you go through.  And how fast they accumulate.|sv
A|Yeah it really is. Well all that stuff and how much, how much we have reduced our waste.  You know, that we, we're generating a week.|aa sv fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I know our neighbors, when we first went to this bin program said, oh, there's no way, you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week. They were real upset but they weren't, they were only picking up once a week. And we said to them, if you recycle, you'll, you know, you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, it's, it's really amazing. The other thing he does, that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings.|sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|No. He, he got a little mulcher thing.|nn sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower and we mow once a week. You know, no, no more often then that. And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the, on, on, the, uh, the lawn. And it's amazing, it's amazing. We don't collect any of that and that, that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, we don't we don't catch it either, mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard. So, if it mows, gets mowed, I do it normally.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it. It's too heavy.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I just I just mow it and leave it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It just soaks in.|sd
A|Sure it does. Sure it does. It really does and it, actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not, uh, if you're catching your grass clippings.|aa aa sv % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That, that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn. It's amazing.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|Oh, I like it better doing it. Well one, it cuts down on my mow time anyway|sd % sd
A|Uh-huh, that's true.|b ba
B|and you zip through it quicker.|sd
A|That's true. That's true. Well, I, I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it.|ba ba sd
B|we probably will.|ba
A|It's, it's really not that much trouble. We keep a large plastic, uh, just a, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And as soon as we use something, you know, we crush it up and put it out there and then, you know, every few weeks we have recycling, a recycling center like near Wal-Mart.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're, they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble. And, uh, I feel like at least we're doing something.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, , um, I read a book one time or a a magazine article and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution but it's not. If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.|sd sd sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|And, uh, when you read that you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.|sv
B|What, what makes me sick is, is when they show the dump sites  you know, and, and, how big they are.|sd
A|Uh-huh Uh-huh.|b b
B|Or like in New York, the barges that that go up and down the, the river|sd
A|Yes. Yeah.|b b
B|and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the , it's like ugh.|sd sd sv
A|Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's, and that's really not necessary.|b b b sv
B|No.|aa
A|It really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference. It would make a huge impact. So, I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano I, I, can't wait for them to get it started. Um, because it'll be that much easier for us, you know, like I said, now we have to take it over to, to Wal-Mart. It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up.|sv sv sv sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. It, it's  it's convenient out here for them to do it.|b sd
A|Um Now what, what do they pick up? It's just,|% qw %
B|They pick up the, the plastic, the glass, and the newspaper.|sd
A|Oh they do?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Uh-huh. And do you have to sort that?|b qy
B|And they will do the|sd
A|Or do you just put it all in.|qrr
B|No, you just put it in the one bin and, and I guess they do the sorting. But, um, they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those|nn sd sd sd sd
A|Right. Right.|b b
B|The kids keep those So,|sd %
A|So you're doing that now? You're doing the newspapers and the glass?|qy qy
B|Uh-huh. Well  we don't, we don't take the newspaper to begin with. When, neither one of us are home  to read it.|ny sd
A|Oh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|So we don't have the newspapers but the, the plastic and the glass At first, when it first started, it, it, it was hard. You know, because you're just used to throwing things.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. My husband would, come home and go through the trash and say, you threw this away|b sd
B|Uh!|ba
A|He would get, he would get all upset and I'd say, it's just such an automatic reaction. And now  we think before we throw anything away.|sd sd ^q sd
B|It is.|aa
A|I mean, it's really funny. We, we really, once you get into the habit of it, it's okay, it's just, it's just making it a habit that's hard|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, I know. Well the kids have even got to the point where they, if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can, you know, they, they're, oh, no, don't do that and they go to the sink, they rinse them out, and they put them upside down, they let them drain and and then, uh, after a couple of days they take them all outside|ba sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, I put them in a big bag anyway|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them. So that's  their activity thing. To go out there and crush.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. That's fun. Yeah, yeah,|b ba b b
B|So,|%
A|yeah. Oh, that's a lot of fun.|aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's a lot of fun. Well, that's great. Well I'm to hear you're, doing that. I, my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.|sv sv sd % sd sd
