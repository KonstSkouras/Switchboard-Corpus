A|Yeah. Is it, like water running and she is doing I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it.|b % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, then again I originally was from California and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California. And, uh  they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.|sd sd sd
B|Surely.|aa
A|And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's ...|sd %
B|You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?|qy

B|Right. I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.|b sd
A|Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.|b sd
B|Oh, really|bh

B|Yeah. Actually, I'm a California born person.|b sd

B|Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.|sd
A|Is it really?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|I would not imagine that.|sd
B|The worst one for smog is Mexico City.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|The most polluted city in the world|sd
A|Huh. You learn  something every day.|b ba
B|. Yeah. I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.|% b sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, I've seen that.|b b sd
B|Uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|You ever heard of that?|qy
A|Huh-uh.|nn
B|Yeah. Methanol?|b qy
A|Huh. No|b nn
B|Yeah. Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn|b sd
A|Oh, yeah Yeah.|b b
B|Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.|% sd
A|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
B|It doesn't make sense. Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world  is corn.|sv % sd
A|Right. Huh. And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right?|b b sd sd sd ^g
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Yeah. Huh.|b %
B|Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that. It's interesting. They're, they're looking at, there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered|sd sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy|sd
A|Huh That is good.|b ba
B|Unlike a car where it's running.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|A electric car it's on demand. I mean it's either on or off.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Basically.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Yeah. There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars.|b sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.|sd

A|Well, yeah. Yeah.|aa aa
B|Kind of interesting so see.|sv
A|Well, it doesn't make sense. Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. So it's  a good, good  vehicle.|b aa sd sv
A|Yeah. Yeah. Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown|b b sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh|b
