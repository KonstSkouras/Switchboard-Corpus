A|So, what do you think about a year or two of public service?|qo
B|Well, I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years, you know, their carefree years|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but people that I have known that have done that, like from other countries, especially, from Germany and Finland, um, they are just, they have such a better, more mature, outlook on life|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|and I think they're better people because of it,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they're much more responsible. I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.|sd sd
A|You know, I, I really agree with you. Um, I, uh, though I've never done that myself, I, I'm, was a basically an education major when I graduated from college and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to, um, very rural children in a very low income district and I spent a year teaching there|aa sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I did it, um, for one reason I wanted, I was working on a masters degree so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think, um, in fact, if I had to do it all again I, you know, after that, you know, you never think of it because, I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.|sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Um, so that was, that was one reason why I never considered it but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans, I, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|um, I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed|sd
B|Huh. and rattling in|%
A|and I thought that was, you know, very interesting and I, I would have thought of that earlier I probably would have done, you know, just like, is that, is this, is that the Mormon church, that does that?|sd sd qy
B|Yes. Yes.|ny ny
A|Because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought, you know, that really, now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, I think so, it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,|b sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. And I think, you know, we have such a need now, you know, I taught, you know, I, I think I was paid, uh, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year|b b sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I worked in a very rural school district and I, I, one of the things I taught was a computer class|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and these kids, um, you know, every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|Many of the boys in the room had children and they were, they were high school juniors.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I just, there, you know, they came from poverty, they were going to condition in poverty and it was, it was, the school district couldn't hire many people, it was very difficult for them to hire, and I think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, um, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, um, things, I think it's a really good idea. And even if it is overseas.|% sd sd sd sd sd
B|Right. Uh-huh.|b b
A|See, I never, I, I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.|% sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It would really, um, and I don't the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend|% % sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b b
B|but still they have benefited from it.|sd
A|Right. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and like she's washing|%
A|Yeah. I think it would also help them if they then went on to college. I know that my first couple of years of college were, um, uh, probably too carefree at the, beginning|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then at the end I had to be too serious.|sd
B|Well, that's right. A lot of people they flunk out or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying|aa sv sv

A|when they're decreasing some of the military spending, some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps|sd
