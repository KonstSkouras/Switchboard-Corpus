B|Right, I, I usually see her a, couple times a year so that's no, no big thing. But, uh, I, uh, I do, I do enjoy the reunions. The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's|na sd sd sd

B|And as, as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's, it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Well, yeah. Yeah, that's, uh, yeah, I think that's some of it. But, you know, I have, uh, I, I, it's just the way, you know, I think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.|b aa % % aa % % sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit, and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. Of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.|sv sv

B|Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion, so, uh|sd %
A|Right, right.|b b
B|you do not really feel that that really close to them.|sd
A|Right. In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City. They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order. And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person. You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|That's a good idea.|ba
A|So, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.|sd

B|Yeah. Right.|ny b
A|We tried to start that in my husband's family. His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and I said, well let's start this letter, and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. I sent it, on to the next one,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
