B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay, where have you all been on vacation recently?|b^m qw
B|Recently, my most recent trip was last year, and that was Detroit.|sd sd sd
A|Detroit?|br
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?|qy
B|Well, it wasn't really. It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.|ng sd
A|Right, okay.|bk bk
B|And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.|sd
A|Right. So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?|b qy^d
B|No. The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.|nn sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|And that was real nice. Uh,|sv
A|Did you scuba dive there?|qy
B|No, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.|nn sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.|b sd
A|Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.|ba b b ba
B|Huh.|b
A|I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.|b b ba
A|So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long|sd sd sd
B|Oh, well, that's nice. Yeah.|ba b
A|Worked at a camp there, and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.|sd sd sd
B|Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, and that's canoeing.|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.|sd sd sd
A|That's nice. We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.|ba sd
B|It's a whole new, Uh-huh.|sd b
A|And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,|sv sd % sd sd sd sd sd
B|Sure. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and we would have to, we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and, That's a good family place to go,|sd sd sv
B|Oh, that's neat. Sure.|ba b
A|and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was like,|sv
B|Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too, and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,|sv sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do|sv
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And you're more receptive.|sv
A|Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.|ba ^h sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to England a few years ago.|sd
B|Oh, that's exciting.|ba
A|I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.|sd sd % sd sv sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.|b sd sd sd sd
A|It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,|sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,|sd
B|Do your own thing. Yeah.|^2 b
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting.|sd sv
B|That's wonderful. There's a lot out there to see,|ba sv
A|Yeah, I know,|b ba
B|I'll say .|ba
A|I keep wanting to get up to, I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States. I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,|sd sd sd
B|Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice.|sv sv
A|Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.|b sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.|sd sd
B|Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around.|aa aa b bf
A|So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,|aa sd sd sd sd
B|Well, you've been quite a few places there|qy^d
A|Yeah, we have. We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.|ny sd sd
B|Once you think about it, huh. Uh-huh.|ba b
A|It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, and you slept on the train at night.|sd sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|But there wasn't a, it was strange, it was kind of sad, there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.|% sv sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh. That's great.|b ba
A|So we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in and got seated, and then no one knew English in there, and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But it was,|%
B|What did you wind up with?|qw
A|Oh, I had fondue. That was easy to say|sd sd
B|Oh, okay|bk
A|Tried to get fondue and white wine, and that was,|sd %
B|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly. There were some people at the next table who spoke English, so we elicited their aid for a while|sd sd sd
B|They kind of guided you.|bf
A|and, they were very helpful|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, It was, it was a pleasant time.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
A|I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.|sd sd sv
B|I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.|sv
A|Right. That's|b %
B|Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about.|b sv
A|That and sleeping late|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|I keep hoping for.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
