A|somebody, somebody abandoned her and, she's only about, oh, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old|sd sd

B|Wow.|ba
A|I mean she actually asks to go out.|sd
B|That's great.|ba

A|Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,|aa sd sd sd sd sd

B|Oh no.|ba
A|So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard.|sd sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so they just felt absolutely awful.|sd
B|Oh, I bet.|ba
A|And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did and, uh. She was really attached to it,|sd sd sd
B|Oh gosh.|ba
A|but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.|sd sd %

A|My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,|sd sd sd ^q

A|And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.|sd %
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.|ar sd sd % sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|But he jumped in, in the, the river.|sd
B|Did puppy go to?|qy
A|Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,|sd sd
B|Oh, that's good, yeah.|ba b
A|'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.|sd sd
B|Ugh, ugh.|ba ba
A|And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b

B|Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off|sd
A|Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year.
