A|Uh, well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time|arp_nd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet. And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.|sd sd
B|Yeah. Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.|b sv
A|We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Was it hot?|qy
A|No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was,|nn sd %
B|Really?|bh
A|well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,|sd

B|So I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been|sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and that I was when I was a baby but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.|sd sv sv
A|Yeah. It was a very interesting vacation. The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you, there were some places, where people,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.|sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|But,|%
B|We, we found that in Jamaica. It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they, they were so destitute and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.|sd
A|The, the worst place was in Marrakech|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you.|sd sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you|sv sd sv
B|Really.|b
A|and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,|sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we were much happier,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Well that's great. Where else have you been?|b ba qw
A|Uh|^h

B|Now when was that, when were you there?|qw
A|Um, August, eighty-eight.|sd

B|No? Didn't have shrimp there huh|bh qy
A|I don't think so.|ng
B|I remember food|sd
A|Oh, I like that too. But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.|sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Oh you're adventurous. You went by yourself.|ba qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Really.|b
A|And I was by myself in China too.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh wow.|ba
A|China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge. But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Was it very expensive?|b qy
A|No, actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, no maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare and,  but this is from Hong Kong,|nn sd ar sd sd sd
B|You're kidding! No kidding! Uh-huh.|ba ba b
A|because I was already in Hong Kong and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Wow! That really surprises me.|ba sd
A|Around a thousand.|sd
B|I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they?|qy
A|Oh, Japan's ridiculous.|na
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in, they were all completely clean,|sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,|b aa aa sv
A|Right. Right.|b b
B|Yeah, yeah. Wow.|b b ba
A|Uh, but yeah, that was, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston|% % % sd sd sd
B|Oh really.|bh
A|Yeah. Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide|ny sd sd sv
