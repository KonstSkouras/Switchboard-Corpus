B|Oh, yes.|b
A|This is great. Well, we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans And, um, we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again. That was pretty pitiful, but they seem to be doing pretty good this year.|ba sd sd sd sd sd ba sv
B|Well, I was from Illinois originally, and I grew up a Bear fan. And, uh, then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans.|sd sd sd sd

A|Yeah. Yeah, well, I am, I'm a big football fan. I never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it.

B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football. So,|sd sd sd %

A|Uh-huh. Well, I do. I just, I love it. It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport. And, uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet. We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet. But, uh,|b sd sd sv sd sd %

A|Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here|sd

B|Are you, uh, transit usually? I mean do you stay not in one place too long?|qy qy

Um, they have these songs on the radio. They take popular songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the Broncos and stuff.|sv % % sd sd sd

A|Yeah. Yeah, they I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado. Because, uh, I, I think about that a lot. But, you know, when I first moved here was when they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. This interstate seventy-five song.
