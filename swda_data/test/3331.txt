A|Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I agree with that.|b aa aa
A|Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,|sd
B|You were?|bh
A|and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, yeah. From what I understand, they act up pretty bad|b aa aa sv
A|Yeah, that's right, that's right.|aa aa aa
B|What, uh, grade is your daughter in?|qw
A|My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade|sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach|sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.|b b b
A|and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.|sd
B|Oh, no, uh-huh. They always had a paddle in our school.|aa aa sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, they, they just don't do that any more.|b sv
B|I know.|aa
A|But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.|b aa aa
A|And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|aa aa aa
A|And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.|sv
B|Yeah. Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?|aa qy
A|Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.|ny sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that but, um, and what else, um, I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.|qw^d ad ^h sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,|sd
B|Uh-huh. No. Really?|b ar bh
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|Ooh.|bk
A|I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Um.|b
A|Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.|sd sv
B|Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job.|aa aa
A|Uh-huh, so.|b %
B|But, then, what do I know, I don't have any kids. No, none at all|qh ng nn sd
A|Yeah, okay, so this is probably a real hard subject for you.|bk bk qy^d
B|Oh, yeah|ny
A|Yeah. Okay, well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.|bk bk fc
B|Okay.|fc
