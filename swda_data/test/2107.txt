B|Oh no, I understand, we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours, we've had, you know, they've been ill, I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,|ba ba sd sd sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy. And then we had a baby and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.|sd sd sd
A|The cat was here first so I know, it's hard.|bf sd sv
B|And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.|sd
A|Oh, how funny.|ba

B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there, they love it. But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Other than that he gets scared to death. If you shut that door he goes into hiding.|sd sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony|sd
B|Yes, uh-huh, that's it|aa aa sv

B|Right, traumatized for life here.|aa bf
A|Probably.|aap_am
B|Oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats.|b % sd

B|We started out with two, with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.|sd sd
A|Oh no.|ba
B|Oh well he lived through it, oh, I couldn't believe it. We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.|sd sd sd
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|The, the cat almost died, and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat, oh he loves life now.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, I imagine.|ba
B|And he's like oh, thank you so much.|sd
A|I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.|sd
B|I know, we wondered about that. But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.|aa sd sd
A|Oh, I can imagine, what did he shoot him with.|ba qw
B|Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.|sd sd
A|Oh my gosh. People are crazy.|ba sv
B|Oh yes, absolutely nuts. But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and,|aa sv sd sd %
A|Oh Lord.|ba
B|I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him|sd sd
A|Oh man.|ba
B|But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.|sd

B|Oh yes. But, uh, we wouldn't we wouldn't have them, I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.|aa sd sd
A|No.|aa
B|There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.|sd
A|Oh yeah, I I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,|aa sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. But I can't give them up.|sd sd
B|Oh no.|aa
A|I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.|sd
B|Right and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.|aa bf
A|Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.|aa sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.|sd

A|Really.|b
B|It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.|sd ^q
A|It's here now, we have to keep it. Yeah, my, my first one that I got, I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.|bf bf b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.|b b b
A|So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.|sd sd

B|Right.|b
A|And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.|sd sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b

B|Oh.|b
A|So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that.|sd sd
B|Right, right.|b b
A|And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, so.|b % sd sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.|sd sd

B|Yes.|b
A|And they just act so funny.|sv
B|Oh, we've got, well the two that were outside, they're like brothers, I mean I've never seen two cats so close.|sd sd sd
A|Really.|b
B|And, uh, they, uh, will get to playing chase through the house,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|A train of cats running around.|bf
