B|Okay, what do you feel are some of the main problems?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qw
A|Well, I'm in a, I'm in an urban area. I'm in Dallas.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem. Uh, in Dallas, some of the major problems, uh, drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now. There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh, people trying to get money for drugs.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.|sv
B|It, it, it's pretty bad here, too.|sd
A|It's not unique,|sv
B|We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff. In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh.|sd
A|Yes. Uh-huh. Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?|b b qy
B|Yeah, that, that Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.|ny % sd
A|Right, research triangle and all of that.|aa bf
B|Right.|aa
A|And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah, it's, it's really, it's, and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or, or or Chapel Hill.|aa % sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever. I mean, it's kind of, I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it, but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst. They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Really?|bh
B|And over half of it has been drug related.|sd
A|Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had. I've, uh, Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, I, I don't know. A, a number every week.|sd % sd h sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, Dallas is having quite a few. Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related. Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.|sd sd sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I,|%
B|Well, that, and the, and the economy is so bad and, And so many people have been laid off and stuff.|% sd sd
A|The economy is lousy|bf
B|They've done special stories on the news, local news here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff. I know, like a week or so ago, I live in a, in a town house, which is, you know, it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work, she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything. And nobody thought any different, they just thought she was moving. It was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.|sv
B|Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad|aa sv
A|Well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?|qy
B|Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we all know one another and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.|sd sd
A|Well, that,|%
B|It's, I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over here.|% sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Most people are, are, retired or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever. So and I'm in my twenties, so I, I'm, I'm out more than they are, but they're at home at night,|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I really don't worry about anything.|sd
A|Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything. Uh, I am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts and, uh, I'm over the northeast part of Dallas. It's a, in a nice neighborhood. The houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, see, that's the same thing here.|b sd
A|But we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. You start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.|sv sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,|sd
