B|Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program. I'm a graduate student, and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise. Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard, so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often. But, um. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.|sd sd sd sd sd sd b b b

A|Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles|sd % sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,|sd

B|Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it|b % sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|Yeah, there are. Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there|ny sd sd sd sd
