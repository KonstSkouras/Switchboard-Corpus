B|Okay what kind of  foods would you have?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qw
A|Okay. Um, well, I like to cook, um|b sd
B|Oh, I do too|sd
A|but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it, just because, um, uh, it's too much pressure. You know,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.|sd
B|Yeah, you can't enjoy it. Right.|aa sv b
A|Yeah. And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.|b sd
B|That's, that's what, I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven,|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|it's,|%
A|Exactly.|aa
B|everybody just says how wonderful it is, and it's it's like, uh, yes,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I.|%

A|.|%
B|I like doing that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it's, it's fun, in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Um. Boy I like that.|ba
B|Uh, I do too, in fact|aa

B|Oh. Oh, good.|b ba
A|So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.|sd
B|Uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.|sd
A|Oh, yeah, uh-huh.|ba b
B|And have, you know, like three or four couples come over, and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.|sd
A|Yeah, that's fun. Uh-huh.|b sv b
B|But it's, it's inexpensive|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it, and you got a great dinner.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that's a good idea.|aa sv
B|It's, it's real easy, I like doing that part.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.|b b b
B|and it's,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that, it's, it's fine, because then I can just say, Okay fine, you bring this, you bring this, you bring this, we're done.|sd ^q ^q ^q ^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it's pretty cool.|sd
A|Yeah, that's good. Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.|b ba sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
A|It's very easy to.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|You don't like it?|qy^d
B|Oh, I love it|sd
A|Oh, you do, okay, yeah. I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it|bf bk b sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want, and then you just.|sd sd sd
B|Over the uncooked rice?|qy
A|Yeah, over uncooked rice|ny sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.|sd sd sd
B|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|It fluffs up, and it's really moist.|sd sd
B|Huh. Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.|% sd
A|Uh-huh, wow, yeah.|b ba b
B|And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes and I'll put in there, and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person but I like it, it adds something to the chicken.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|And then just bake it, and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.|sd sd
A|Well, I'll keep that one in mind.|oo_co_cc
B|Yeah|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um, yeah|sd b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,|b aa bf
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|or, you know semi .|sv
B|But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.|qy^d
A|Yeah. You put in, um|ny sd
B|Um.|%
A|let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice or,|sd %
B|Um.|%
A|It depends on, you can really vary it.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.|sd h sd
B|Yeah, yeah, I, I use that for for rice and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.|b b sd sd
A|Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.|b ^2 b b
B|Um. Now that would be good.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|How long do you have to bake it?|qw
A|Um, let's see. I think it was an hour. I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.|^h sd sd
B|I do, I do microwave too, a lot|sd
A|Yeah. But, I think it's about an hour.|b sd
B|How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?|qw
A|Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.|sd % sd
B|Oh, okay. Okay. Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored|bk b qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|or do you go ahead and let it cook through?|qrr
A|Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.|sd
B|Um. Ooh, this is a beneficial call. I like this|% sv sd
A|Yeah, I liked your idea too, there.|aa sd
B|Yeah, but that one's an easy one. It's like, just put in, a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine|b sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.|ad
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|But it, it makes a great, I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, because my daughter calls it her gravy and I mean, she thinks it's wonderful, my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to,|sd sd ^q
