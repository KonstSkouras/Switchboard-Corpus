B|Yeah.|b
A|Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
