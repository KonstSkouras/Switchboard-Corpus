A|So, uh, what kind of home repair work have you done?|qw
B|Well, um, done a little, uh, repair on the, uh, shingles on the roof recently. We've had a lot of wind around here.|sd sd
A|Been pulling them up, huh, or just loosening them until the rain came in?|qrr
B|Yes. It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again, because we may have a leak.|ny sd
A|Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain?|qy
B|We've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio, but, uh, well, I'm right, Plano's just north of Dallas|arp_nd % sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now, I guess, I saw on the news.|sd sd
A|Yeah. But you're probably, what, about halfway across the state from San Antonio, though, aren't you?|b qy
B|Well, we're up, uh, we're north and, uh, oh, about, uh, I don't know, uh, eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line, I guess.|arp_nd
A|Yeah. Yeah, okay. But you're still getting a good bit of the rain, though.|b bk bk qy^d
B|Uh, we did have a little bit of rain yesterday. So far we haven't had any today. And, uh, I suppose that means I should be, uh, getting up there to look at that, uh, shingle, but, uh I had something else planned today,|ng ng sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I guess I'll let it go awhile.|sd
A|Yeah. Is it asphalt shingles, or, or .|b qy %
B|They're, uh, no, they're, uh, wood shake.|% nn sd
A|Ooh, that should be a lot of fun.|bk sv
B|Yeah|b
A|Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them?|qy
B|No, I, uh, as a matter of fact, we've never had a leak actually yet. Now this, we just bought the house last year, and, uh, uh, just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles. So, I've just recently had to start looking at it myself.|nn % sd % sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, it's a small problem so far, but I guess you just have to keep on top of it. What kind of roof do you have?|sd sd qw
A|Uh, we're in, uh, campus apartment buildings with flat top, uh.|sd
B|Oh, then you don't have to do too much with it|qy^d
A|Not too much. They're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs.|ng sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof, or is it pretty steep?|qy
B|Oh, it's pretty steep. Uh, parts of it are steeper than others.|sd sd
A|What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal?|qw
B|Well, uh, you wear, uh, shoes with good traction, and, and, and try to remember where you are at all times|sd
A|Yeah, I imagine, I imagine.|aa ba
B|And remember to yell Geronimo, if all else fails.|sd
A|Yeah, yeah, that would be just too much of a fall for me. Um, have you been, uh, was, was the house reasonably new, or you been doing some remodeling work on it.|b b sd % qy qrr
B|It's actually just twelve years old, now.|sd
A|That's pretty new house yet.|sv
B|Yeah, it, uh, this part of the country, actually, they say that when the house is, uh, fifteen, it's already old, but just take good care of it.|aa % % sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Thing is, we've, uh, the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some, uh, squirming, I call it, of the foundation. We're just on a concrete slab, you know|% sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, the soil right under this is a clay, and it, uh,|sd %
A|It's settling unevenly?|qy
B|Well, it, uh, depending on its moisture content, it either swells up or shrinks, and, uh of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer|arp_nd sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from, uh, from, uh, drooping|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, but anytime there's a change in the weather, like the temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, uh, moisture, uh, you get little spider web cracks all around, uh, windows and doors.|sd
A|Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.|sv
B|Well, usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped, and then you patch them up|sd sd
A|Um. What is it like, uh, stucco walls or,|qy
B|Uh, well, this is all, uh, it's all drywall|arp_nd
A|Oh, drywall.|bk
B|uh, I think, with, uh|sd
A|Wood framing?|qy
B|yeah, right.|ny na
A|Okay.|bk
B|But, uh, somehow or other that does manage to, uh, show these little cracks. I don't know quite how that works. Maybe it isn't drywall. I don't really know.|sd sd sd h
A|they plastered over drywall.|qy^d
B|Yeah, I think it is.|ny sd
A|I remember my parents home is drywalled and then they, uh, almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look,|sd
B|I expect that's what it is, yeah.|sd %
A|and made for kind of a hard shell on the, on the drywall.|sd
B|Yeah, I think that's the way this is done. Fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so I,|b sd sd %
A|Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, that would, that would be in terribly, terribly exasperating to have the, the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that.|b ba b b sv
B|Yes, well, the previous owner had a major problem with it, because, uh, oh probably a variety of things. His neighbor used,|aa sd sd
