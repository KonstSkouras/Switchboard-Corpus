A|Um, now if I'm ever home during the, during the day on a vacation day, I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually, because he's just, he's one of my idles. And then, uh, but I don't know, it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings.|sd h sv
