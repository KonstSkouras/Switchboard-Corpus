A|And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea, and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.|sd sd
B|Oh, it sounds fantastic.|ba
A|Yes. And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, uh, like your rice steamer,  your rice cooker.|aa sd
B|Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer, and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.|ad ad

B|And how much shrimp would you use?|qw
A|Two pounds.|sd
B|Two pounds, okay.|b^m bk
A|That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.|ad

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,  and the shrimp turn pink.|ad
B|Okay. Uh-huh.|aa b
A|Then you remove it, and you put it on a platter. And then you serve it with melted butter. And, uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine.|ad ad ad sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And they can just dip it, and they shell it as they eat it.|sd sd
B|Sure.|b
A|But, uh, then the uh, the cauliflower, you,  cook that in the microwave.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what you do is, you just, uh, wash it, and you core it. And in a like a, oh, what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave.|ad ad
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. A glass dish.|b b qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder, and I mix it all together. And I shred up some just regular white cheese.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it, and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that. And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,  just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.|ad ad ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,  it's done.|sd
B|Yeah. Oh, that sounds fantastic.|b ba
A|It is good. But it, it looks, I mean, what you can do then, see is, like what I usually do is, I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle, and then I put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it,  you know, on my platter.|sd % sd sd
B|Um, um. Uh-huh.|b b
