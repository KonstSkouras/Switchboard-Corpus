A|Well, I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the last time that, um, we tackled it, I did the kitchen. And I had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark, it was called a sassafras, it was kind of an orangish brown.|sd sd sd sd
B|Okay.|b
A|It was not real pretty.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Anyway, so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color.|sd
B|Uh-huh, I see.|b b
A|So I tried to cover it with white, and it was quite a, a feat getting that dark a color covered, and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets, and know if I look underneath my cabinets, I'm not satisfied with the jobs I, I did on it because there're splotches.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I'm glad it's done, because it's brighter.|sd
B|Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. Well, we, uh, I just got married about six months ago, and we bought a house at the same time. So we're, I'm sitting here in my forty year old house, and we're about halfway through the painting process|aa aa aa % sd sd % sd sd
A|Oh, lord.|ba
B|So, uh, the only, uh, I guess the, the big discussion, just kind of what you were mentioning, has been the color. We ended up with our, our living and dining room are now, uh, kind of a, a light peach color with, uh, and it's got all the old, original hardwood trim and stuff, so we've got the trim in kind of, uh, kind of an off-white. And this is really the first, uh, interior painting project that I've attacked. And, it's, it's been, uh, it's been something else, to say the least. We, we had the same type of situation. Uh, the walls were, uh, uh, well, they weren't, the color difference wasn't so bad, but, uh, there was semigloss underneath|% sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we put a flat over the top, and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint.|sd sd sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can. But, uh, we've learned. We, we, uh, we worked, we've worked our way back into the hallway, and, and we're in the middle of the bathroom now. But, uh, it's, it's been quite an adventure. The other, the other thing that makes it, uh, a little more difficult, we've got all hardwood floors, and, uh, we, we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the, since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth, toothbrush and what not cleaning up.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|So what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried?|qw
B|Well, it's, it's not too bad. It, it, uh, the floors are finished with a polyurethane,|sd % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's really not to bad to get off, *typo to too it, it, we're just using latex, and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even. It, it, it, uh, comes off with like a mild abrasive pad, like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and and soap and water. So, we got pretty lucky on that.|sd % % sd sd sd sd

A|And then I have been coloring my hair, and I'm real haphazard when I do it. So I've got dye on my bathroom door.|sd sd sd

A|And then we have a two story.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|We did the outside of it one summer.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That was horrendous. I mean, I, I couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder. I could get up on the roof and do that.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I dread that the next time.|sd
B|Yeah, I, uh, Yeah, we, uh, our house was painted as part of the purchase contract, so we didn't have to mess with that this time. But I've, I, I grew up on a farm, so I, I've, I've messed with outdoor painting a little bit, uh, but most of that, it was done with a sprayer and, uh, up in the bucket of a loader tractor, or something like that, so, it took a lot of the hassle out. And then they're,|b % aa sd sd sd sd sd sd %

A|Everything else is white.|sd
B|Oh, gosh, yeah. Just, just the opposite of what everybody's, uh, working towards now.|ba b sv
A|Now have you thought about this? That wherever you buy your paint, you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business.|qy
B|Yeah, yeah, absolutely Yeah, we, uh, we stocked up the first time around. But we've definitely got all the formulas on file, and, uh, we're, they'll be there for a while. We're, we're pretty comfortable with that. But, yeah, it, it, I'm, I'm real nervous every time I, I open a new can. I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a, in a washtub or something somewhere because I'm I'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match.|ny ny na % sd sd sd sd % % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh. It's gone pretty well. It just, it, it, takes, it takes some time. My problem is, while I, I'm not overly proud of it, but I'm a self-proclaimed, proclaimed perfectionist, and it, it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that. And I'll find, I'll find something as I'm going along, something not related, like, like, uh, I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because, they, they really didn't match. They were, a few of them were broken and things like that. So, I always pick up these little extra tasks as I'm doing this, and, and the painting actually takes probably, uh, a fourth of the time, and I'm always doing all this other stuff, and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else I've come home with from work this time to, to put in, a ceiling fan or something strange like that. So uh, it, it, it always, it, it, it gets you to look at everything real hard when you start putting a coat of paint on everything, you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere.|sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd

B|Yeah.|ny
A|Spots in it.|qy^d
B|Yeah, it's, it's been, uh, we, we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend, you know, spend a lot of time working on it, and, uh, it was part, you know, part of the excitement was, was getting a good deal on an older house that just, it really hadn't been taken care of very well. It, it was actually, it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that. So, we uh, we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it. But, uh, there just isn't enough time, I, I, I find myself going to work knowing that, that there's a job about half done at home, and I really, if I would, if I'd just stay home and finish it, I'd feel a lot better, but, uh, I'm, I'm starting to learn that there's always something else. Once you get done, you can always start over and, and you make up all kinds of excuses.|ny % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd sv sv
