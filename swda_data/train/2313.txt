B|Um, I've only, I've got about four maybe. I try to limit them because I, well one, I don't use them too much. And I use my Visa just for for about everything, and I pay it all off. So I try not to, I just use it for free money for thirty days basically.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Sounds like we have no conflict. We had, for a while I was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one. And since the slips all look alike, uh, you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out, uh, and it, uh, it caused more confusion about it. I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time. And then when A T and T came along and offered a free one, uh, I accepted that, and we've been using that one. Uh, the interesting thing is, is that, uh, the amount of money you can can run up on them. I don't know, do you know any people that run up big, big bills?|sv % sd sd sd sd sd sv sd sd sd sv h qy

A|Just curious, because I have a son that's a senior this year, and he's heading off, with any kind of luck, but there has been, I've had a couple of ads for, for, for to provide a card for a college student.

B|Uh-huh. I'd say, you know, have one with, you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something.|b sv
A|Yeah, and the idea that, you know, if he got in trouble, there's some, some ways of getting out, and that he doesn't have to carry cash. The, uh, I, I like the idea of credit cards that, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't carry cash around, and, and, uh, I don't even carry checks around. I let my wife take the checkbook, and she writes the checks, and I record them. So it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, but it's interesting that, uh, the people that can, that can, uh, the amounts of money you can run up on, on credit cards, and, uh, I, I had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up, he was making, oh, considered a modest salary for an engineer, and he had run up, uh, more than a years salary in, in various debts to, and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there, it, it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty, thirty thousand dollars of, uh, well, it was a combination of things he had,|b bf % sd sd sd sd sv sd sd sd sd % sv sd

A|The interesting thing about that is, is that, uh, that, that they're encouraging you to incur more, incur more debt, and,|sv %
B|Well, it's, it's, it's business, and they're making money off that.|sd sd
A|And they make more money if you extend your loan.|sd
B|Yeah, and, and it's, so it's business, so, and you notice that they're, they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old.|b sd qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
B|And so they've already shifted the risk. If they assume that car, then they just have to sell it themselves, and they'll recover the loan,|sd sd sd
A|And they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service *listen; can't be right transcription they're not going to keep on if the car were older.|sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The interesting thing about it is is that from a, uh, uh, an economy standpoint or in economics, I, I thinks it's, I think it's poor, poor, uh, economics to, to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint,|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so. It's interesting that, that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible, and this year it's ten percent or so.|sv sd
B|Yeah, uh.|b %
A|It's, uh, it's interesting that, that, uh, they encourage us to do things,|sv
B|What, now what's ten percent, we can deduct,|br
A|I think ten percent, yes.|sd fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|It's on schedule, um, Schedule A under, uh, well, it's the same place, it's the same place you put, uh, interest. But, but see that's what, that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that you can't, you can't take out a, a second mortgage, like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that, and so, uh, it's fully deductible. The laws are a little squirrelly, but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint.|sd sd sv sd sv sd sv

My wife will write a check for groceries and, you know, almost, well I guess it's the day after, uh, technically it's two days, but they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account, and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float, but apparently that's why the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, grocery stores are reluctant to do that, because their volume, that is quite high, and they have, uh, the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them.|b sd % sv % % sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd sv % sv
