A|You know, after a while you make some stuff, then you start looking at it, go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby. Um, he does it, believe it or not, I wouldn't imagine why, but to get out of the house, away from his wife, because he's a seasonal worker, he works in the construction. And up here it's almost a pattern, and you see your fathers do it, then their sons do it. What they do is they work construction, then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter. And, uh, this guy was going nuts, and his, uh, son built him a garage and got him some, uh, oh, I don't know what the equipment's called, but planers and things and set him up,|sd sd sv sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little, little companies of one and two guys, you know, up there, this particular one, I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire, where out in the, just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in, they may be the same kind of people you're talking about. You know, they've, they've got twelve weeks to do something, and they, they're making furniture and just, you know, things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer.|sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, it's really, it's, it's, uh, hard work. I couldn't imagine taking lumber, raw lumber and trying to make something out of it. He He dowels everything.|sd sd sd

B|I don't know where they came from. They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that.

A|Oh, that's good. I guess they, they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all .|ba sd
