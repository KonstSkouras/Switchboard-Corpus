B|Okay, in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it|ad ad ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil. Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. Stir it real, real well.|ad ad ad ad ad ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy. And you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.|ad ad ad ad
A|Oh.|b
B|And that's going to, it's going to be really good|sv
A|That's very spicy, too.|bf
B|Yeah, it's,|b %
A|I mean these bell peppers and curry.|bf
B|Right, and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.|aa sd
A|Oh, that sounds really good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Huh. I guess it was, is this dinner time for you?|b sd qy
B|Uh, well it will be in a little while, I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.|na sd
A|All done in advance, yeah. That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook but I was single until I was thirty so I did cook a little, you know.|bf b sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, and I cook a little bit now. What I like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.|sd
B|What kind of wok do you have, is it, is it a real Chinese wok.|qw qy
A|It's, it's called a stir fry pan and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. I see.|b b
A|And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil. But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things. And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand. That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've used, you turn them over. A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not|% sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things, so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.|sd
B|Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,|sv
A|It's, it's a pretty big and we put that over rice.|sd sd
B|I just don't like squash.|sd

B|And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'd just be,|sd
