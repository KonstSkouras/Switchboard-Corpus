B|I've never heard of such a thing.|sd
A|I know. That's what I'm saying that, that pensions, you see, just like you were, you're saying, you've only got, uh, so many years, And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.|sd sd sv

A|No, no there isn't. I, I'm saying that's the question. What do you think could be better and I'm saying that pensions, say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away, which it probably will, I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose. So you work for a company seven years,|ar ar sd sd ^q sv sv sd
B|Yes, by all means. Well, what would be the difference between that and social security?|b ba qw
A|Uh, well social security's going to go to way, I think and you can, or you can invest your own money. You have no control over your social security. And it's not paid for by the current, like when, say we retire after the year two thousand, social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds. it's there.|sv sd sv sv % sv sv
