B|And good afternoon to you.|fp
A|Do you, uh, do most of your cooking at home or do you, uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?|qy qrr
B|Um, no. I do most of my cooking at home and, um, I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner party.|nn sd sd
A|Uh-huh. My goodness Well, what would you, uh, like to cook? What's, what, what's, what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to have for a dinner party?|b ba qy qw
B|Um,|b
A|Now you're in Dallas, is it?|qy
B|Right, I'm in Dallas.|na sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues And,|sd %
A|I was, I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost, Tex-Mex.|sd
B|Uh-huh, yes. Yeah, uh, Tex-Mex, uh, Mexican food, um probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party.|b b b b^m sv
A|Uh-huh. Well, that's a very interesting food though and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|We have, uh, I think Chico's or, or in these different restaurants in this area that, uh, have all this fine Mexican foods.|% % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, um, if I were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard to you but, uh, actually I never get too much fried chicken.|sd sd
B|Fried chicken. Uh-huh.|b^m b
A|And I love twice cooked potatoes.|sd
B|Oh, yes, I have. Uh-huh. Right.|ny sd b b
A|And, uh, I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|As you can see, I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal|sd
B|Right|b
A|And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, how would you improve upon that?|qo
B|Oh, improve upon that? Let's see. I'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in. And some,|b^m ^h sd %
A|More fresh vegetables?|b^m
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Included to that?|qy
B|Uh, green beans and, uh carrots and things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh. How do you cook your green beans?|b qw
B|My green beans?|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Um, I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes.|sd
A|So you|%
B|And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them.|sd
A|All right that's what I was wondering about. What, what you use and, and in herbs and so forth.|sd bf
B|Uh-huh. Right, uh-huh. Um, I like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there.|b b b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it makes them pretty tasty.|sd
A|Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans?|qy
B|The Chinese type. Are they the real,|b^m qy
A|We use soy sauce,|sd
B|No, I haven't ever used that.|nn sd
A|Well, you might, uh, be interested in that. Have, it gives a very delicious taste. You, you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the, uh, water and,|sv qy sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, golly. What's this white powder that, that, uh, that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce?|qw
B|A white powder.|b^m
A|I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment.|sd
B|Um, gosh.|ba
A|Anyhow sorry about my mind.|% fa
B|That's okay.|bd
A|But, uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it. If it does|sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it, it brings out such a, so much different things in, uh in the string beans.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I like it to try them differently.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you might, uh, think about that.|ad
B|Yeah, I might try that.|aa aa
A|Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them.|sv
B|Oh, yes. I love Chinese.|b sd
A|And, uh, north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous.|sd
B|North African? Uh-huh.|b^m b
A|And that's, uh, made from, uh, I think they call it, beans. And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish. You probably have to buy that from specialty stores.|sv sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|C o u s, c o u s. And that's a, a north African dish. They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa.|sd sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|And it is very very flexible. You can do a lot of things with it. It makes a fantastic, uh, uh, salad with cucumbers and, olive oil and onions and,|sd sd sd %
