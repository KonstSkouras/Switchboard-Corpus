B|What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?|qw
A|Um, well, it depends, it's very different in the different places, but,|^h sd %
B|Is it programming related?|qy
A|Yeah, yeah. Program related, research related, and I work in the speech field, and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,|ny ny sd sd sd

A|and I do that type of stuff typically for other people, and we, like here we use the P C to do that. Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.|sd sd sd
B|Word processing.|bf
A|Well, more, uh, do you know Latek? Word text processing,|ar qy

A|so I don't, I don't use, I mean, you can call it word processing, but I don't usually use a word processor to do it|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and we don't have too much standard software. Like I haven't bought, we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all. So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that. We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal, and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.|sd sd sd sd sd

B|So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh. So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear. So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up. Um, yeah, and often times that, I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call.|ny sv sv % % sd
