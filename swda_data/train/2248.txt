A|All right. Now, we used to be big time campers but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd
B|Uh-huh. What type of camping did you do?|b qw
A|Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we went like twenty or thirty at a time. We took, uh, just our little tents,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we did it that way. Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,|sd sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and we did it that way.|sd
B|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|So, we've always enjoyed camping.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent, and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then I bought a van and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable|sd sd
A|yes. Now we have friends with a van,|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.|sd
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|Like one night and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they enjoy it.|sd
B|Yes, I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes, to camping.|b sd
A|Oh, yeah. Oh, me either.|b b sd
B|All the bugs and stuff But I, I try|sd sd
A|I hate to be on all that stuff|sd
B|But, but I try, you know, to, uh, to get out there and enjoy everything.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
B|But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy,|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and it's all over him. The poor thing, you know, so, there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at|sd fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv
A|Yes, yes.|aa aa
B|Oh, shoot.|ba
A|Oh. But now, I enjoy it every once in a while, I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm a sissy.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I either want to do it in the fall or spring.|sd

B|Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot, and they, uh, they've been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama. And, uh, which is really, really neat.|sd sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.|sd
A|Oh. I'd like to go anywhere. You know, I just like to go.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|I really do.|sd
B|Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and, and those parts, in the mountains?|qy
A|No, not really, not that much. Um, we've been, well, we've been to Wyoming, you know, and Kentucky and Montana and, you know, places like that. But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.|nn ng sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.|sd
B|Right, right.|b b
