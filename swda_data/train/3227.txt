B|What kind of music do you like?|qw
A|I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time, and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music. Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes. I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues, and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything.|^h sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,|sd
B|Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even.|qy
A|Right, right. Uh, well, that gets, some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music, and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do, but the, the actual,|b b ^h sd sv %
B|I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even|ar
A|Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music|sv
B|Yeah, I guess.|aap_am aap_am
A|um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|%
B|Do you like rap?|qy
A|Um, some of it, um, it depends. I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um, and they usually do a lot of satire|no h sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|um.|%
B|that kind I kind of like.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Some of it is kind of pointless,|sv
A|Right, the monotonous the monotonous,|b ^2
B|yeah.|aa
A|no that's not, I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah.|aa sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't like that.|sd
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|I like the funny, satire, and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society.|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It really does. It talks about, um, race relations and police relations and, um, that, that|sv sd %
B|I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I'm, with you though, I like classical|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway. I like easy listening, just kind of, you know, I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more. I used to like it all right, but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason. Um, let's see. Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that. Some of it's okay, uh|sd sd sd sd sd ^h sd sv
A|Yeah, that's, that's about my opinion of that|aa sd
B|yeah|b
A|It's, it's okay, um,|sv
B|Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess, so|sd %
A|Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western|sv
B|a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar, yeah.|sv aa
A|and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music. They just play a certain number of chords|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|the drummer plays a certain beat, and you have a country and western song|sv sv
B|Um.|%
A|and,|%
B|Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess. They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are|sv sv sv sv
A|Um. Right.|b
B|you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too.|sv
A|Yeah. And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll|sd
B|Yeah earlier things.|b bf
A|and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ...|sd
