A|Okay, Deanna, uh, on capital punishment in our state, they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I believe also in shooting of, uh, rape, I mean killing a rape victim. I mean someone in the process of rape,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

B|How do what do you think about it.|qo
A|I think it's justified.|sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|aa aa
A|Very much so.|sv
B|I agree, I, I, agree, you know, I,|aa %
A|I think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman|sv
B|Yeah, oh, I do too, I do too.|aa aa aa
A|I mean, I think they're doing their duty, but I think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it.|sv sv
B|They ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman.|sv
A|That's right, I agree.|aa aa
B|Yeah. I agree. Uh, I heard something on the news the other night they were talking about, uh, oh, I know what it was, it was in our, in our little local paper, our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week, uh, there's a little thing at the bottom it's like a call in survey that says, you know, do you think so and so, and then you call this number and you press like one for yes and two for no.|aa aa sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Right, uh-huh.|b b
B|And one of the things, the questions the other day, this last paper, and I haven't seen the results of it, I'm anxious to, was do you think that, um, capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers. Which I thought was a real interesting question|sd
A|Oh I think, Right, right, did you see SIXTY MINUTES tonight, by any chance?|% b b qy
B|No, I didn't, huh-uh.|nn sd nn
A|Well, they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers. He's just a civilian, he's a black man,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he just got fed up with it.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything, trying to keep him quiet,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|but he's organizing people, and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory|sd sd
B|You know, I think that's what it's going to take, though.|sv
A|I think so, I think,|aa aa
B|I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I think, I don't think can do it, can do it alone, you know.|sv % sv sv
A|That's right, I think you're right.|aa aa
B|It's going to take, uh, it's going to take all of us getting together, I'm sorry, I'm trying to, my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed It's going to take all of us, you know getting together and just saying, we are not going to take it any more.|sv % sd sv
A|Right. We won't allow this in our neighborhood.|b sd
B|That's right, that's right.|aa aa
A|And it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then quite often they'll get shot, because they're horning in on somebody else's territory.|sd
B|Uh. That's right, that's right, uh.|b aa aa
A|I think they said forty-one had been shot out of one church in the last year.|sd
B|Oh my gosh. The only thing about the death penalty and, and I know that, that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years, you know.|ba sv sv sv
A|Right, I know it.|aa aa
B|you know if, if, you know I, I think to be, you know being convicted is one thing, you know, and that's, and that's great if they're if they're sentenced to death, to me you could not sentence them to death unless, the case was for sure. I mean it|% % sv sv sv %
A|Well it goes all through the it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're,|sv
B|Right, right, by the time it gets there and they've been convicted and then they've been sentenced to death, they're sure. I mean there's no doubt, I mean, I,|aa aa sv sv sv sv sv %
A|Uh-huh, then it should happen, yeah.|aa sv %
B|there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind, there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty.|sd sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|So once, they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt, do it, you know, just,|sv %
A|Right.|b
B|I I guess, I mean that may sound, that sounds cold, but gosh, you know, we're keeping, you know we're, we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row, and not doing anything with them,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh, that's right.|aa aa
B|and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money and that's terrible to look at it that way, but.|sv sv %
A|Yeah it is, I know but that, that's the way it is|aa aa aa sv
B|if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death, then do it, you know, uh.|sv

B|I really you don't.|sv sv
A|Huh-uh.|aa
B|If they're the kind of people that commit these excuse me, grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again, you don't reform those kind of people.|sv
A|Huh-uh, and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me.|aa sv
B|No, no, and I don't know, the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas, you know.|aa aa h sv
A|Right, yeah.|aa aa

A|That's right, yeah, yeah, I do too.|aa aa aa aa

Men breaking in, uh, to houses and taking, or a man, they, they think it's the same person, taking, uh, little girls right straight out of their beds at night. And, you know, breaking in, obviously watching them in the house, because they're breaking into the right window, you know, the little girl's bedroom.

B|Never be the same, so, I don't know, it's it's really scary and I don't know what to, I don't know what needs to be done, you know it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there, you know, I'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and, so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases, you know|sv h sv sd sv sv sv sv sd
A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|and he said you can pretty much, you know if you ever get on a jury, you know, you're not told this, but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess, whatever you sentence them to, they're going to serve about a quarter.|sd ^q
A|It's going to be reduced, right, uh-huh.|aa aa aa

B|I don't know.|no
A|and they don't seem to,|sv
B|That's the thing, we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're going to have to say, if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime, you are going to be sentenced to death period, period,|sv

B|We're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years, we're really going to do it, you know.
