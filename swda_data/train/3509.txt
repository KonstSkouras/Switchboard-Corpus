A|So, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
B|Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment  penalties.|sd
A|Right, you don't think,|b %
B|Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know, I mean, there is things that seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do. Now, you know, I mean somebody, a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard, you kind of, I don't know. What about yourself?|h % sv sv % h qo
A|I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh, it's, you know, it seems right sometimes and then other times, you don't know.|sd sv sv

B|I mean, people, like, I, it's been, I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having effective, effective punishments and, and they're extremely severe. Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because you never know if it's going to be applied. Right, unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand and  and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand|% % % sv sv sv sv sv

A|Right.|b
B|Uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact, or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm, I mean, sure, their life is taken, but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway, so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the for the you know, what they've done.|aa sv sv sv sv sv
B|some people, Yeah. Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year, it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. To keep people in jail.|% b sv sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...|sd
A|Right, but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway, so uh, it's,|aa sd %

B|It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the well, I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment. Uh, Texas has had it for a while. It's one of the quickest, it, it, once it was, it was reallowed, I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution and it seems like everybody stopped and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.|% sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd
