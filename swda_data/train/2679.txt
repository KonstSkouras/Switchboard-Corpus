A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, um, uh, cooking for people. And, uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, uh, you don't have to do all that much work. You know, you just, uh, slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go.|sd sv
A|Yeah. We have them too, and I, I'm trying to think which is the, best, uh, that I prefer.

B|Uh, you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish.|sd

B|Yeah. And it was just, it was just wonderful. That's, that's something that I would really like to, uh, to try and find the recipe for. But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time. Because you can, you can put it on top of the stove, and do this,|aa sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh, yes.|b b
B|and, and there's so much broth and juice in there,  that it has to, uh, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it to, uh, uh, to come out fluffy and, and nice.|sd
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And that was, you know, when you were talking about the, the Polish dishes, uh, some goulashes and things like that. That's, uh, that's what I thought about, was that Armenian rice dish.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, yes, we probably ought to try this. But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered. I guess it gets better and better as we remember it,  back, as we get older, you know.|ba sv sv sv

A|Oh, really?|bh
B|And all the juices and everything are all sealed in. And, I tell you what, it's never failed to come out tender and juicy,  and just  and just delicious. Because I normally don't like ham, because it's so salty.|sd sd
A|Oh, I haven't heard  of that, yeah. Yeah.|sd b

But I would like to put one in the oven, you know, the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours, and see if, because I don't think in, in my married life, which is, uh, twenty-six years now, we've never done that, you know.|sd sd sd sd
