B|Uh-huh. Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I don't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately. I, like you, say yes let's have it,  put them all, give them all a shot, get rid of them.|b sv aa sv
A|Well,  Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty.|sd

A|Now that's tougher. It's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way to go, it's a deterrent to crime, they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway. But to be the actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me.|sv sv sv sv sv sv

B|Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that. Uh, I, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to.|sd sv
A|Well, yes, but, you know, that's what they did.|aa sv

B|Yeah Uh-huh|b
A|And they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the human life.|sv

A|Hang them. Yeah, I agree it should be in effect. Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh, so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect but I want maybe well, I'd, I, now I have a problem with this, too.

They don't, uh, they never, strangely enough, uh, their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up.
