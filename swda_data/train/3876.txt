B|Okay, so now what are your opinions on recycling?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qo
A|Well, I definitely think that we need to start recycling. I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until, I think if we wait, uh, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.|sd
B|Yeah, I have heard that too.|b sd
A|And that is not too far away, but I don't know how it is there. It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much. I take, my paper, I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store|sv sd sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.|sd sd sv
B|Well see, I started saving newspapers and I would take a ton of them|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, that's, I can't remember where I went to take them, but they wouldn't take them.|sd sd
A|Yeah. It is real hard to find a spot and then, I don't know if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles|b sv sv sd
B|Oh I know.|aa
A|glass that cannot be, it could be recycled, but there is no place to,|sd sd sd
B|There is no really recycling facilities.|^2
A|No. We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out.|aa sd
B|I think that is a good idea.|sv
A|And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.|sv
B|Besides, well like a law or whatever. that's how it is in New York isn't it.|bf qy
A|Yeah. I think so, just because they have to. You know,|b sv sv
B|Uh-huh. And you get ticketed if you don't do it right.|b sv
A|Right, uh-huh. And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the, it's, It's trouble for me to do what I do|aa aa sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, I am willing to do it but,|sd %
B|Plus you have to have a place to store all of it|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and see I live in an apartment.|sd
A|Yeah. It is very difficult. Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers and, so, I don't know. I think there needs to be more places and also I have a real strong opinion. In Iowa, the state I am from uh, I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.|b sv sd h sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and then you take it back to the store and you get it back.|sd sd
B|Uh, so that way it kind of forces you to recycle.|bf
A|You are forced to. And, uh, you also don't see the litter there. People just,|aa sd %
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
A|It makes it worthwhile to take it back and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian, I don't know if you've tried it|sv sd qy^d
B|Yeah, I have seen them.|ny sd
A|and they have on the it's five cents, that they pay five cents|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it even shows the states that,|sd
B|That take them back.|^2
A|Yeah. Well, some of them are five, some are ten cents. I am looking at it right now.|aa sd sd
B|Is Texas one of them?|qy
A|Texas is not one of them see. So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass.|ng sd
B|Yeah. No, I don't think that there is enough being done. Now, I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters.|b aa sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we have a paper recycling program that, uh, is company wide and I do the recycling for that.|sd sd
A|Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper.|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Good. Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.|ba qy
B|Yeah. And I know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use.|ny sd
A|Right. Right.|b b
B|But, uh, we use to have, uh, I mean, I don't even remember how much money that they've, uh, I mean, the money that they've made from the recycling program. They have donated it to charities.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|I mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it.|sd
A|Yeah. Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton|b sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you add well, I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later, but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.|sd sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I want them to have my business. And I think packaging could be done much better. There is so much plastic. But,|sd sv sv %
B|Well I know, you see some of the stuff and then when they come out with the new things, you are like, well why didn't you think of that before.|aa sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah. And I think that it's just people have got to be aware. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't want to think about it.|aa aa sv sv sv
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
A|And, uh, I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something. You know, I want to feel like I at least tried.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I don't know. It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it. Then we will be forced to. It may be too late.|h sv sv sv
B|Do they not ever, I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,|qy
A|Very little. That's another thing that, see there were no,|ng % %
B|Then, that's pollution.|sd
A|I know Amway. I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material. Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah, I know. I guess you run into the pollution factor.|b sd sv
A|Yeah. And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And there is no place I can take glass to.|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|So, I still throw away a lot of glass.|sd
B|It is really sad.|sv
A|Yeah. And then the packaging thing really grips me. You buy some and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic,|b sd sd sd
