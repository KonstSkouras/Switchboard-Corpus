A|Okay, uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I basically read books.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It is, I do. Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed, so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am, I have about three books that I am going on. And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one. But that's just kind of,|% sd sd sd sd sd %
B|Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.|sv
A|Not always, just sometimes.|bd bd
B|Oh, yeah. And what what kind of books do you read?|b qw
A|Uh, just really different ones. Uh, I have one that I was reading on, uh, raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another one on, uh, uh, uh, like a crime story|sd sd
B|Oh yeah|b
A|A true crime story.|sd
B|Oh, do you like those detective stories?|qy
A|Yeah. But this, it was a true one. It was just a little different though. Reading that one last night.|ny % sd sd sd
B|Oh, well that is interesting. Actually, I like to read also, but, uh, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.|ba sd sd
A|Yeah, like my husband.|b sd
B|Yeah|b
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah, kind of one or the other.|b sd
A|You must, uh, work for T I?|qy^d
B|Yes.|ny

B|Yeah, and I am a computer scientist.|b sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, I have a lot of other hobbies.|sd
A|Uh-huh, really.|b b
B|Well, yeah, I am kind of, uh, I guess what you would call it, a project person.|b sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Yeah, and I love, like I have a shop and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself and so, hobby, it's, it's funny, uh, from the one stand point, it is work. But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy to do.|b sd sd sd % sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|To find broken,|sd
A|Yeah, yeah. What kinds of things do you fix?|b b qw
B|Well, essentially anything you find in a house. Uh, a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, uh, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.|sd
A|Oh. And you have a shop?|b qy
B|Well it, it is not anything elaborate. It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.|na sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,|sd
A|Yeah, you can fix just about everything and anything.|b ^2
B|Right.|aa
A|Well, that is great.|ba
B|And in the car, I guess the car too.|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so, uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby. Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive.|sv sd
A|Yeah. That is pretty much like my husband. He is, he is pretty, uh, mobile in that area too. He, he works on the cars. He rarely takes them in|b sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah I,|b %
A|and, uh, he works on irons, and all T V and stuff too. We rarely have to take those things in too.|sd sd
B|Right. Yeah, I think it, it, not only can it be fun, but it can certainly help your finances.|b b % sv sv
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.|aa aa aa
B|So, do you have any art, uh, how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies?|qy
A|Uh. Not really. I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, uh, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.|ng sd
B|Oh yeah, well that's good.|b ba
A|But, but, uh, not really|bd
B|Yeah. Well, I don't necessarily either. I can plink out a song or two on a piano|b sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I can, uh, I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art, I guess uh, graphic arts is that what they call it,|% sd sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|I can't do any of that, but sweat shirts is certainly impressive.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh, I belong to this organization for, uh, if, if you have preschool children|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, uh, section for the moms|sd

A|and those are really neat and we learn to do the, uh, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos|sd sd
B|Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and, uh, those are really neat. So we learn different crafts like that uh|sd sd
B|I see. Well, that is neat|ba ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|I guess you could consider that a hobby. Do you, do you cook for a hobby or do you,|sv qy qrr
A|No I cook dinner|nn sd
B|That's not something you,|sv
A|I don't consider it a hobby|sv
B|I understand that.|ba
A|But, uh, you know, I no I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.|% nn sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I like to bake off and on. And usually once a week I will bake something, but it's not anything elaborate, you know|sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|At least, I don't think it is.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So,|%
B|But, I think that still borders on hobby.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. Uh, on the computer.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I have little projects little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh-huh, that is very good.|b ba
B|Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?|qy
A|Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading, and I stopped because it was so, it's the book is so detailed|sd sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you have to, sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all. And, uh, it is so detailed,|sd sd sd
