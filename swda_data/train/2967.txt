A|So what movies have you seen?|qw
B|Uh, well, I have, uh, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the, the best movie that I have seen lately. Uh, I do not go out to films very often. So, as far as out of the house.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in, uh, and I see some that way. But, uh, I am not real current on films. How about you?|sd sd sd qo
A|Yeah. I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, uh, HOME ALONE and,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd %
B|I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet.|sd
A|Yeah. It is.|aa sd
B|Yeah|b
A|It is about a little kid that, that his parents go off to Paris.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they, they forget all about him. The oldest daughter, they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of,|sd sd
B|Oh, cute.|ba
A|And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble.|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|So she made him go sleep upstairs.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And there is, there is a couple of burglars, uh, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood.|sd
B|Oh,|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Oh, and he hears them or something and,|^2 %
A|Yeah. And he sets up traps for them all over the house.|aa sd
B|Who wins?|qw
A|Uh, he does.|sd
B|Oh, great, great. Yeah, I had heard people talk about it, and they say it was really cute, but I had not seen it.|ba ba % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, we usually wait and eventually it comes out on video, and then we get it and see it that way.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And that is, it, movies are very expensive. Uh, movie theatres here, they are six dollars, uh, for evening performances. And that is kind of steep,|sd sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think. I don't know. How much is it in Dallas?|sv sd qw
A|Well, it is six dollars, and then but you get, um, matinee prices. But,|sd sd %
B|Yeah. You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, you know,|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, that is taking the middle of the afternoon. And if I am looking for entertainment usually I, I, have more, uh, time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to, uh, see things. What do you think of movies in general? As far as the, as the trends?|sv sd qo qo
A|Well, I think they are a lot better than they than they were, well, like, um, in the early eighties or the, during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When it was, they, I do not think they were very good during that time.|sd % sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|At least there were not as many good ones.|sv
B|Did, Yeah. The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect.|b b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a tougher rating. Which suggests that, that, you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public. And a lot of times it is added for no real, uh, valid reason.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, which does not make, and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added. It was just all legitimate kind of, uh, film. And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars, uh, because it really was good even though it is such a long movie. You know, they said, "Oh, people won't, won't be interested in a three hour movie." But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone.|sv sv sv sv sd
A|And it was shocking at the end too. So,|sv %
B|Oh, oh, yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Absolutely. Uh, but much more true to life and I think that is, that is the point.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah. That is right.|aa ba
B|Uh, they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I hate sequels too. I hate these, uh, you know, number one, two, three, four.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Usually if a movie is good, once is enough|sv
A|Yeah. Especially JAWS.|aa sd
B|Right. That was on Prime Time Television here, uh, recently at seven thirty in the evening. And, uh, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie, uh, at that hour.|b sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I thought, that, you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, uh, I mean when they were young. And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, which was a, it was a good movie. I mean it was well done but, uh, that is one reason why it was scary.|sd sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, but I do not know that I have seen any of the, uh, sequels to that. I think one is enough.|sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh,|%
A|Just more of the same.|sv
B|That is what people say.|sd
A|In one of them they have a mother shark, uh, destroy a whole, uh, marina and aquarium. Which is kind of far fetched.|sd
B|Oh. Yeah. It, just a touch.|b aa % sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched.|sv
A|They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.|sv
B|Not, not too often|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know. If you hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's funny. Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs.|sv sv
A|Well, uh, every once in a while, I go, but it, it has to be like somebody that I like or,|sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know. I did not, I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then when it was, I, I found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on, um, I guess A B C the other week, then I,|sd %
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|Yeah. And then I really liked it.|b sd
B|It was good.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was very good. But, uh, um, uh, see I have, uh, teenagers in my house. And of course sometimes they rent movies and, you know, have friends over or something. And sometimes movies are here that I did not, I am not even aware that I could have seen, you know. Because my family tells me that, that, that it had been actually in the house before|sv sd sd sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|But I had missed it. But I did see it on T V, and I thought it was good.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah. It was really, and then, and then, uh, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player. I thought they made him up, and then I found out, you know, after I saw the movie that, they, they started talking about that scandal and,|b % sv sd %
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah, when the, when the anniversary came up|ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that was around the time of anniversary, you know.|sd
B|No kidding.|b
A|And then it was on the news.|sd
B|Oh, I did not realize that. Yeah. Uh, you know, the character that, uh, James Earle Jones played?|sd b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, uh, I teach in school, and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, I do not know, I had not heard anybody talk about it. But, uh, he certainly could have been. Uh, which was kind of interesting. You know, someone who, uh, who was a real activist but then took up the cause. Uh, kind of gave up, you know, because he did not think anything was happening,|h sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so, uh, it was kind of fun.|sd
A|Yeah. And I wondered who it was too.|b sd
B|I do not know for sure, but there are certain, uh, qualities that suggest it could be he. Because they were, uh, they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse. That he had stopped writing and had stopped, you know, and that is true for Ellison. He, he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it. And, uh, has pretty much dropped out of public life.|h sv sd sd sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|But he is still alive and that, you know, that is what makes it so interesting.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN.|qy
A|Uh, I What is that? INVISIBLE MAN?|% br qy^d
B|INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.|qy^d
A|Uh, no. Huh-uh.|nn nn
B|It is an incredible book. It, uh, really is very, very interesting. I highly recommend it.|sv sv sd
A|Uh, did they make the movies after that or,|qy %
B|Uh, the, yeah, the movie, the in FIELD, FIELD OF DREAMS came out after, uh, that novel.|% % % % % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it could easily have been patterned after him. But the, the movie did not have anything to do with, with the story that I am talking about. But|sv sd %
A|Right.|b
B|I just thought the the, uh, author could have been patterned after that, uh, I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sort of interesting, so. Well, I guess we have talked probably our time limit, haven't we?|sv qy
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
