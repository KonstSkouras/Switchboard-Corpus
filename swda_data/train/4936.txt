A|Why don't you start?|ad
B|Oh, I don't know. I, uh, I refinished a couple of old, uh, dressers that were handed down. You know, nice it's nice tongue and groove, uh, uh, construction. Uh, that's been, I've been pretty successful with that.|h sd sd sd
A|Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that?|qy
B|What?|br
A|Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing?|qy
B|No, I've done some other things too. Uh, you know.|nn sd
A|Yeah. I've done both|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, uh, my wife has picked up a couple of things saying, uh, boy if we could refinish that, that would be a beautiful piece of furniture and, uh, we've done it a couple of times. I guess that  we've been fairly successful with those.|sd sd sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|That's, uh, that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess.|sv
B|Yeah. That's a good way to get started.|aa sv
A|Uh, I have a, a, uh, really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital, uh liberated it after a fire|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and, uh, we stripped it all the way down and refinished it and it turned out to be really nice, uh, a nice desk. Maple top I think or or something of that sort.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah. I, I, uh, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch.|b b b sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|You know, a kit.|sd
A|Oh. I'm jealous.|ba
B|Yeah. Still had to cut it and everything, but it was fun.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah I, I do do things, uh, that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and, uh things like that.|b b sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. I, I've done the same. You know, like the trim around the house you know  the baseboards and things like that.|b b sd
A|And, uh  I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. My, I, uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so I do have a band saw and a router and, uh, things like that out in the garage. But I can't say I use them very often|sd sd
B|Um. Yeah , I'm looking at trying to get a router right now.|b sd
A|They're handy, uh, they  they come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm, uh, I bought myself a, uh, template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel|sv sd sd sd
B|I'll bet.|aa
A|But I've, also, I've also used them for building drawers where you, uh, for rabbeting and, uh, because, uh, rabbeting on my table, on my, uh, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it and now I use it twice a year maybe|sd sd
B|Yeah. My my brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't  know,|b sd h
A|The big,|%
B|what, what's your opinion of what a good router is like? You know I,|qw %
A|Uh, I guess it,|%
B|Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff.|sd sd
A|The ones that what?|br
B|That you dial in on the side.|sd
A|Uh, I have never even I have never even looked at one closely. Uh, the, the little use that I've gotten from my router, I would say, uh, I would spend my money on the bits|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Uh, I have a, I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the, uh,|sd %
B|How strong is it?|qw
A|It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time. But the problem is that the, uh, as with any, any time you buy a, a  tool with a, a, as a, as a package the bits that they give you are low end.|sd % sv
B|Don't they, Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|% b b
A|So the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, I mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars and, uh, uh, if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. Because uh, I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself, uh, they won't last And I've never had the bits sharpened So.  That's a thing to consider is to,|sv sv % sv sd sv
B|Uh-huh. They, they really get hot don't they?|b qy
A|Yeah. And they, they dull after awhile. Especially, I did some cabinets in, uh, ash and oak|ny sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, that, that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets, uh which had been in the original, remodeling of our kitchen.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth And, uh, routing hardwood will, uh, take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast So.|sd sv %
B|Yeah. I've cut some one by eight oak before Boy was that fun.|b sd sd
A|Right. That's, uh,|b %
B|Big solid pieces of oak are just tough.|sv
A|And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened, right|qy
B|Well, that was, you know, with a, with a circular saw.|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like, oh my gosh.|ba
A|Right.|b
B|Is this going to be fun|qh
A|Yeah Well I've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening. Because, uh, treated wood will also chew them up.|b sd sd
B|Yeah. Treated wood can really make you sick too.|b sv
