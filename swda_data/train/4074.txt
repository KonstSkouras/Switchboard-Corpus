A|That's odd. How does he treat the other people?|ba qw
B|Just, uh, stays away or runs usually.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around. You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap, but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing.|sd sd sd
A|Did he raise him or something?|qy
B|He's, he, we bought the cat for him and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him. But I, I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody|sd sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so,|%
A|Would you ever want a dog in the family?|qy
B|Uh, we, I would. We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador|na sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him|sd sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet and it was a dog that we gotten and he was, he was just too big.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the kids couldn't handle him and I was still going to school and my wife was working and I was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of you know, he was too big for the kids to handle, so he was just tied up to a post|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so we gave him to, uh, I don't know if you've, there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they have, uh, I guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we took him up there and he ended up keeping him. Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years. We, we've, saw him just about a year ago and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
