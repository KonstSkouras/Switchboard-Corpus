A|What was your favorite all time movie?|qw
B|Um, oh gosh, I I can't think off my head. Do you know which one yours was?|^h qy
A|I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most, uh, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, uh, STAR WARS.|sd
B|Oh, yeah, well that's,|b %
A|When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, I guess, uh, out of all the movies, I've, I've never been as excited to go back. I was ready to go back and see it again, you know|sd sd
B|Really. Yeah, yeah, you're right about that, but that that's really like an all time classic. I mean, I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.|b b b aa sv sv
A|Now, I, I also liked, uh, oh, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA|sd

B|That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school|sd
A|Oh, yeah. Actually, I just saw a movie, uh, called THE LOST CAPONE. And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers,|b sd sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|and I won't give the, the whole plot away but it's, it's really a good movie. Uh, Al Capone had three brothers,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and one of them was lost for many, many years and, uh, he actually, he turns out to be a law man.|sd sd

A|Yeah, it is.|ny sd
B|Okay, I may have to do that. Go see it, or go rent it.|bk sd sd
A|And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress,  and seeing like all,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I've seen all of James Dean's movies.  Uh, all of Mae West's movies.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, just kind of, kind of go out and, uh, rent all the movies and, uh, uh, you know, just kind of go, I guess you could do that, you know, get all of David Carradine's movies,  or, uh, uh, Segal,|sd sv

B|Oh, I don't, I don't watch that Um,|sd %
A|It was really kind of interesting because,  Arsenio was asking him about, uh, what he thought of, uh, one of the other action guys.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|God, I can't even remember the name. He said well, he wouldn't really talk about it. Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a, uh, a good action guy.|sd sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|It wasn't Stallone, it was, uh, I can't remember. Shoot, I can't remember the guy's name. But I like all the, the RAMBO movies.|sd % sd sd sd
B|Oh, see, I didn't really care, that's, that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for but see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't think he's really a very good actor. I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful but I just have never been a Stallone fan.|sv sv sd
A|Yo, Adrian|^q
B|Hey that's pretty good. No, I guess like I say, I just have, I don't know, I just have never seen any interest in him, but.|ba b sd sd %
A|No, we, we actually rent, uh, probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.|b sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Don't watch really very many horror films at all.|sd
B|Yeah, I don't either|b sv
A|You know, I don't know, there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you, or something, you know,  coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day, you know.|h sd
B|Yeah, you're right. Well it's so, I guess, I'm a real, I'm a realist, and so, when I watch movies like that, it's like this can not happen. So, I just don't enjoy it, you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break.|aa aa % sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I mean, I just and so many of them are done so poorly,|% sv
A|Yeah.|b

A|I just saw, uh, uh, a really interesting movie called, uh, FLATLINERS.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and it was just, it was done so well, you know, it was just,|sv %
A|It was just crazy enough for you know students might try to do it. You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.|sv sv sd
B|Right, well that's probably true But it was a very good movie. It was done real well too. I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, this can't happen. It seemed it seemed real, you know it was really good.|aa aa sv sv sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|That, that was one, I mean it's not my all time favorite movie but it was good, it was really good.|% sd sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, um, I don't know if you like this kind, but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too.|qy^d sv

A|Yeah, it is, it's kind of, uh, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse.|ny sd sd
B|Oh|bk
A|But it was kind of cute. Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS?|sd qy
B|Yes, yes.|ny ny
A|I though that was a really cute movie, I enjoyed that.|sv sd
B|Yeah, it was. TWINS was good too, because when I thought of that, I thought of, anyway. Um, oh, there was another one, what's the one that just, oh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet?|aa aa sv sd % ^h qw qy
A|No, I haven't.|nn sd
B|Oh, you've got to see that one, it's really,|ad %

B|Right, that's probably true, that's probably true. It's, it's very, very good. Very good.|aa aa aa sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's another one that, I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it.|% sd
A|Well my wife, uh, has got a, uh, a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed it. It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES.|sd sd sd
B|Really.|bh

B|Oh, yeah, it's really worth it. I mean it's a very good movie and yes, I would suggest seeing it at the theater. I know that they're still playing it and they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until like August,|aa sd sd ny ad sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August, so. But, yeah, that one is definitely worth seeing, it's really good.|sd sd % sd sd
A|Now did you see, uh, DRIVING MISS DAISY?|qy
B|Yeah, and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good.|ny sv
A|Okay.|bk
