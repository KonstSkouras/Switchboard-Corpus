B|Oh.|b
A|and I thought wow, I mean, how, one person is doing that, you know, but my, my thought was it's a shame, I mean, it's wonderful that she's doing it and it, but wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it, because her effort would have really, um, really, uh, been a good example for all of us. And yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time. And here we are, you know, now we're doing it on a, city wide basis in, in communities.|sd sd sv sv sd sd sd sd

A|and so it wasn't, you know, something that was being picked up or, um, and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would. But I remember her saying yes, I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that, and a trash can for the other thing, and I thought wow, that's, that is wonderful, that somebody does that.|sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh. Yes, and they appreciate how much it costs to do that. Yeah. That's right. Well, I don't know, you know. I, I wonder how, how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to, to make this whole thing work. I mean, the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, uh, making sure that, uh, you take stuff over to, you know, some people are now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside, you know, and I think golly Moses, you just do your part.
