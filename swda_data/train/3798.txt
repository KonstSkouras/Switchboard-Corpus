A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, my, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for.|sv
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|or I think they already would have by now, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now. I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, you know.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, what about you?|qo
A|Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now You know.|sd

B|Uh, I don't,  I'm not sure, uh,|sd
A|I mean, I, go ahead.|% ad
B|I know, uh, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research, you know what I mean?|sd qy
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|ny b
B|And, uh, that sort of thing. Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know|% sd
A|Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I can see that research is needed and, you know,|b b sv %
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Definitely.|aa
B|I think so, I think so.|aa aa
A|I mean it's becoming a major problem.|sv

B|And, uh, I don't know, I don't think that's a bad idea.|h sv

B|I know it, uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It just sort of keeps that going.|sd

A|If they're perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then  you know,|sd
B|Yeah. You know, I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as something to, to do about it.|b sv
A|Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|So, so I don't know. Uh, course, there's so many things in the world where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another you know.|sd sv
