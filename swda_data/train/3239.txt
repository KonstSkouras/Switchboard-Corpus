A|Well, do you have any pets?|qy
B|Yes I do. I have a dog named Grisly, who's a ten year old, uh, mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow.|ny sd sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|And I have a pair of box turtles.|sd
A|Oh, I used to have box turtles, um, well, years ago, when I was growing up|bk sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|I, I really like them.|sd
B|Oh, yeah, I do, too. Lucky and Spot, that's their names|b sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room, and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle, and always has his nose all around my turtle box, so do you have any pets now?|sd sd qy
A|Yes, um, we have one dog, a Bichon Frise. Um, our friends in Houston bred the dogs. I had never heard of them|ny sd sd sd
B|No, I haven't either.|nn sd
A|they're, um, they're all white and they're small, and, um, and fluffy, they don't shed. I guess they're distantly related to a poodle, but they're not very well known in this country, and they're not, um, high strung or over bred um.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh. And how big do they get.|b qw
A|Ours is, uh, on the small end, and she's about ten pounds, and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds|sd sd sd
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|and they love people, um, and kids and that was something we were looking for, um, our, our love is Golden Retrievers, and that's what we had intended to get in Houston, but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water, um, and we thought that was kind of a tough climate|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|the water, yes. Yeah.|sv % b
A|so, uh, we ended up getting this, and, uh, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|now he wants a, a good size dog|sd
B|Uh-huh, well, we've got a good size dog, and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature Dachshund, and I miss having a little one you know, around.|b sd sd sd
A|Oh. Yeah.|b b
B|The kind you have sounds very interesting, though.|ba
A|Well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs. We've, uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and, and bred them. They had five litters of puppies, and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|because, um,|%
B|And how do you spell that breed?|qw
A|It's B I C H O N F R I S E.|sd
B|F R I S E. And how do you pronounce that?|b^m qw
A|Bichon Frise.|sd
B|Okay. I'm writing it out phonetically,|bk sd
A|Yeah. They're, uh, and they don't shed so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with allergies,|b % sd sv
B|Yes,|b
A|and they love people, and they're,|sd %
B|Do they bark a lot?|qy
A|Um, no, not really. Ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house. We used to swap back and forth dogs. they have three dogs. They had a Cockapoo, and, and two Bichons um,|nn sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|and, uh, now it's funny. She's, she's a good watch dog|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and if there's, she'll bark that way, but she also talks a lot, she um, has a definite personality|sd sd sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because she doesn't want to be left. Um.|sd
B|Oh. Does she ever mess in the house?|b qy
A|No, no, and they're, um, they're very smart dogs. The circuses in Europe used to use them um, for the acts.|nn nn sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|They, uh, oh, they'll dance on their hind legs each|sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh, gee.|b ba
A|um, but they're very easy to train|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,|%
B|And about how much are they?|qw
A|Well, they range, I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper. They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think which I thought was a lot.|% ^h sd
B|And how about the, And how about the person in, uh, Houston?|qw
A|Well, she's no longer breeding them|arp_nd
B|Oh.|bk
A|but, um, because her dogs, um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter, and, uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, um, pets, you know they weren't, weren't show quality.|sd
B|Oh, yes. Just pets, Yes, that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl. We did that every weekend,|b b b sd sd sd
A|Oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time.|sv
B|Yes, and it's very expensive.|aa sv
A|Yeah, um, but she might have some contacts here, I know I know that the dog's grandmother, um, was from Plano,|aa sd sd
B|Oh, that's where I live,|sd
