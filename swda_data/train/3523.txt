A|We're set.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|What changes do you feel have happened?|qw
B|Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote. I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were and that's probably going to increase. You know.|sv sv sv
A|Right. Increases each year, doesn't it?|b qy
B|I'm sorry?|br
A|It increases each year I think.|sv
B|It sure does. Yeah, there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.|aa aa sv
A|Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.|sv
B|Role? Right.|^2 aa
A|And, uh,|%
B|That's changing|sv
A|Well, we do to some degree|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.|sv
B|Right, yeah, I, I agree. It definitely has changed.|aa aa aa sv
A|I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else.|sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.|sv
B|Well, you know, they've been talking about and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it, but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out,|% h sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.|h
A|Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave. Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave.|sd sd
B|Oh, is that right? Oh. Uh-huh.|bh b b
A|And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do, but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either and that was the reason because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men but, So, uh,|h sd sd sd %
B|Huh, that's interesting. That's a bummer, though|ba sv
A|Yeah it is.|aa aa
B|I mean, You got to take the time off|sd
A|You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time. You do. You have to save all your vacation time and that's usually how it's, uh, happened,|sd aa sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What do you see, uh, changing in the future?|qw
B|I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females.|sv
A|Right, and, and  top level.|aa %
B|And we'll I'm sorry?|% br
A|Maybe top level.|sv
B|Right, right, upper management, more women in upper management and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles. More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that.|aa aa sv sv sv sv
A|That would be kind of nice|ba
B|Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.|sd
A|That's right, that's right.|aa aa
B|And we had a female mayor here in Dallas, and she just, her term just ended and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future|sd sd sv
A|Yeah I think that's probably good. A little more integration.|b sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners and,|sv %
B|Right, you know, I mean, and that's fine with me|b ba
A|I think,|%
B|but sometimes, I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means, but I do,|% sd %
A|Right.|b
B|there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But, I don't get into the, uh, the real  women libber movement, you know.|sd
A|No, I don't either. I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal|aa aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We just function differently|sv
B|Right, right.|aa aa
A|And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh,|%
B|Right.|b
A|and they're probably, I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.|% sv
B|Yeah, I, I've heard of that. Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that. But, I mean, I think that is a,|aa aa sd %
A|I think that,|%
B|Like the cottage industry. Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes?|sv qy
A|Right.|na
B|Yeah, uh, I think it's wonderful|bk sv
A|Right. You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week and,|b sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,|sd
B|Oh, I By the phone and all that.|% ^2
A|so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that and some ways, it might be kind of scary.|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|Think anybody could do it, but, Anyway,|sv %
B|Right. Yeah, I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up|b b sv
A|Right. Right, but then you know, there is the process of selection. Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices|b b sv qh
