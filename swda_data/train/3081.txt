A|Right.|b
B|And, then, um, let's see, and then, and you heat up refried beans, and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese, and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first, then you put the meat, then you put the grated cheese, and then you put, um, let's see, what's next, then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the, um, lettuce,|^h sd sd sd sd sd sd ^h sd

B|I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to, I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.|sv sv
A|They must, they just said they never had it at home. So I, I was concerned that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so I just,|%
B|It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.|sd
A|Oh, does that help?|qy

A|Okay, well,|b %
B|That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.|sd
A|Well, I'll have to remember that. Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would,|oo_co_cc sd sd
