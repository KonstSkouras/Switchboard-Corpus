B|No. I'm not in the middle of anything. I've just, about the last thing I did about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. So, I guess that,|nn sd % % sd %
A|The whole thing?|qy
B|Yeah. That, that was fairly large undertaking. A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house.|ny sd sd
A|Did the framing and all?|qy
B|Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking.|na
A|Huh.|b
B|That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that and.|sd sd %
A|and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work|sd
B|Yeah, that's the exact opposite. We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up. We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that.|aa sd sd sd sd sd

B|I we didn't know a thing about any of that and so,  It's, it looked very hard to do|sd %
A|My wife wishes I hadn't done that.|sd
B|so, we figured well just, I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living. But,|% % sd sd %
A|I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'|sv
B|Probably so and I, we'd never done it so we just left it alone. But that's, I guess, I'm only twenty-one so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much. So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents so.|aa sd sd % sd sd sd %

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it. I don't know. He, well he did all the flooring himself. He put the whole, the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. It's not, you know, it's not enclosed. It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park and it's,|sd sd h sd sd sd sd sd sd sd %
