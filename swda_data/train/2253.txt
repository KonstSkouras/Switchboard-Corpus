B|So.|%
A|What, uh, what kind of,|qw
B|Well, I just finished, just, I just finished one last night. A great book. It, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien.|sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And it's, uh, God I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories.|% ba sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Strange book. Beautifully written.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|By, uh, somebody who was there or,|qy %

A|Yeah. Well, any of the guys that were ground yes. Yeah, I can imagine.|b % % % ba
B|Yeah. So, what's the latest one you've read?|b qw
A|Well, I tell you what, I'm a kind of, uh, a history nut. I'm trying to think back now, I read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books.|^h ^h ^h sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, the last, uh, I'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, uh, one of the, the Michener, uh, LONE STAR or the, the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.|sd
B|I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work.|sd
A|Oh, well, I've had similar problems. It does tend to, to,|sd sv
B|Have you, are you a Civil War buff at all?|qy
A|Yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah|ny ny
B|Because I finished one, I think this is like two years ago, and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the Civil War, John Jakes with ,|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and the novel didn't do that much for me. But, boy, the period of time was fascinating.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or, yeah, I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM.|% % sd
A|BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .|b^m
B|It's kind of like a historical compendium, of the Civil War,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's not a story of the Civil War, it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events, that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's fascinating because I had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War.|sd
A|Uh-huh. There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?|b qy
B|There was a lot more to it than that. As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought.|na sd
A|Yeah, well, it was a political move.|b sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the United States. All the other areas which would, I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, oh, may have been Kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They didn't emancipate them.|sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|My husband is always, you know, talked about Texas being a, uh, rebel state.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, oh, my God, all this Civil War pride. I kept waiting for, where's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War.|sd % qh
A|isn't much there, was there?|qy
B|They might as well have not even been there.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, they weren't a state and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, you know, who's going to be going there. And I keep telling my husband that, and he keeps saying, oh, no. I thought, okay.|sv sv sd sd sd
A|They supplied some, uh, you know, they were some groups of it, the Vicksburg, if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg, the battleground at Vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some Texas, uh, groups and they had an interesting time there.|% sd sd sv
B|Oh, I'll bet they did.|aa
A|And down there at Sabine Pass, uh, I can't think of the guy's name but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.|sd sv
B|Well, you know, why they actually held them off? None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar|qh sv
A|That could be it could be it.|aap_am
B|Now, you didn't hear me say that. Outside of, uh,|ad %
A|And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde, you know, over there on the Texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at Eagle Pass. And they didn't get across the river there so they're, the last, and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last, organized battle between the two units was in Texas,|sd sd sd sd % sd sd

B|Well, I've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, I get out like, you know, two or three books.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|In the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot.|sd
A|I just turned around and looked at my brief, at my briefcase, my, uh, bookcase up here and I see ARMAGEDDON up there.

A|Yeah.|b
B|Which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things, and I still even then I was so, so disgusted with it I, I tried to read, I don't remember which other one it was, whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller.|sv sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I just, I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more, I thought, I can't do this.|sd sd

B|Well, I loved that novel. And then somebody said, oh, God, this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston and it was raining all night, and I had a hole in my roof and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse, and, uh, I was reading DUNE.
