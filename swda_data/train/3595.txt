A|Oh|b
B|and I was thinking yeah, and I was thinking|sd
A|Birmingham.|b^m
B|the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.|sd
A|Right. It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country.|aa sv
B|Yeah, well, tell me what kind of books have you read?|aa qw
A|Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years so mainly, text books.|sd sd
B|I was going to say, not fun kind, right?|qy
A|No, um, but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones|nn sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, you know, sometimes I just read one about Grace Kelley. I love to read about real people. To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, it is, because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing.|aa sd sd
A|Yeah, it happened.|aa sd
B|You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.|sd

B|Yeah, that was real good. I'm like you, if it's not a heavy biography, you know I enjoy it.|ny sd sd sd
A|Right. I used to like to read about royalty a lot. I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe. That was my thing for a while.|b sd sd sd

A|Yeah, I've heard that she's done you know, her books are really interesting, and they always sell well.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, you know.|sv
A|Yeah, brings it to life. I know, uh, the some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.|aa sv sd
B|Yeah, but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, you know.|aa sv
A|I know, our movie stars.|aa sv
B|Our movie stars, because it's totally different concept to us.|b^m sv
A|Oh, right.|aa

B|Oh, she is wonderful.|na
A|Oh, once you I don't like to get one of her books because, I, I just live to read. I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to the book|sd sd sd sd
B|I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I I could not put it down.|sd
A|Oh, yeah. She's just a, I don't know, does she, how often does she come out with them. I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.|ba sv h qw sd
B|Well, no, it seems like she doesn't write as often as, oh, well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things. She writes the same thing.|ar sd sv
A|Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.|sv
B|Yeah, and, and they're the same silly things, I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's, It, it's practically the same thing over and over, you know.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah, I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think. And think how rich she is.|aa sd ad
B|Yeah, wouldn't I, you know, I'm criticizing her, and wouldn't I like to have her money|aa qh sd qh
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them.|sd sd
A|And then make movies out of some of them.|sd
B|Uh-huh. You know, mini series and so forth, and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often. I have not seen as many of hers.|b sd sd sd
A|Well, hers are so involved, and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. I think she does a lot of research, too.|b sv
A|I do too, so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,|aa sv
B|Huh-uh.|aa
A|but oh, her books are just incredible. I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?|sv qy
B|No, I don't think so, and I've often wondered why, haven't you?|nn sd qy
A|Yes|ny
B|You know, I,|%
A|well, no, uh, I really just thought about it now but there's just,|ar sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|Maybe it's because they take so much in. I don't know.|sd h
B|Uh-huh. Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, you know.|b sd
A|They're so big|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they're such, you know, it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie|sd sv
B|Yeah. And maybe that turns people off, but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.|b sd ad
A|Oh, I know. It's about one of my favorite movies.|aa sd
B|Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?|qy
A|No, it had such a bad press, I wasn't too .|nn sd sd
B|Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. I was amazed, because I, in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad,|aa sd sd % sd
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|and then when it came out, all I heard was just, oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.|sd
A|Me, either. Do you know anyone that's read it?|aa qy
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|No, I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.|aa sd
B|No.|b

B|Well it wouldn't surprise me,|sd
