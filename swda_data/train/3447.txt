A|The way, I'll go ahead and start the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day.|sd

A|A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess.|sv

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b

B|Well, I'm a drafter, so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and I have sweatshirt on today.|^h sd sd

A|So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,|sd
