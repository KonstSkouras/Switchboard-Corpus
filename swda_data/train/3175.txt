B|Hello.|fp
A|Hi, uh, basically, I wear pants. I'm a real pants person and, uh, like when I'm at home since, and I'll say, I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, uh, I wear a pantsuit most of the time. Not a pantsuit, I guess pants and a shirt and, uh, in the summertime I wear cotton tops. Cotton top shirts and in the winter I wear, uh, like sweaters. I like sweaters a lot. And so I do that. But when I go out for meetings uh, then I will wear either, uh, skirts or, uh, a dress and I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time, but, that's basically what I do.|fp sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Well, I think our tastes are fairly similar, although I am I government worker, I do tend to, I'm, uh, a scientist.|sv sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So that technically, I suppose, I could get away with, with extremely casual clothes, but, for the most port, part I don't. I wear fairly respectable looking shoes and and a pantsuit of one sort or another|% sd sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, I guess dress it up with a, with a, a very nice black jacket when I have, have visitors or have to give talks.|sd
A|Well, that sounds nice.|ba
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, it said the seasons, do, do you change much through the season or,|sd qy qy
B|No, actually I guess this summer I, I wore some fairly nice jeans uh, more than I have in previous seasons.|nn sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, no, I tend to, to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer. I don't know whether they think by, you know, freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during the day or something.|nn sd sv
A|Maybe.|aap_am
B|But but, you know, you wear a heavy sweater in your office, all summer.|sd
A|No.|b
B|So, right, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't, I, you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends.|% % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of, of secretaries was, you know, overdress, over kill, sort of|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and in a in a sense, the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would, would be to spend this money here|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up.|sv
A|Then Uh, well, I don't have the resources to just go out and buy, buy, buy anyway and so my don't change dramatically over the years. If I need something new, I will go and buy it. But, basically I'm a, a pretty much the same in the summertime I wear the light cotton and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters.|^2 sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|And, so, it's not a whole lot of, of change for me either. And, uh, especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses I, I, I enjoy that, but it just wouldn't be, uh, smart for me to do that in my home with my children.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I have to, uh, think about things like that, too. I have given seminars before in, in creative writing and things like that. Now, I don't know if they consider that a job. I don't really get paid for that, uh, often, but, uh, when I do that then I, I think I become more businesslike. Uh, but it doesn't really change my clothing style.|sd sd h sd sd sd
B|Exactly. I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a the same pant suit you would, you know wear for other things.|aa sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah, I'm, I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics.|% sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And so I used to have a problem when, when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh, dear. That's not helpful.|b ba ba
B|right. But otherwise, now, I'm, I guess we're both pretty practical|aa sv
A|Yeah, I guess so Well, it's been great talking to you.|aa h fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|Have a great day.|fc
B|Well, have a good day.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
