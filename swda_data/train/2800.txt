A|I don't, guess we got our first, uh, credit card, oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when, I first got married|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|was a Visa card. Uh, issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|because my sister worked at the, uh, the Visa some Bank Americard center there. *one utt with a.3 utt2?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, we were still in college and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified. They've come in handy over the years.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes.|sd
B|Oh, tell me about it|ba
A|Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And, uh, I find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, staring those bills in the face and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up.|sd sd sv
B|Yeah, they add up quick|aa sv
A|So, sometimes, uh, especially traveling with T I, you know, everything goes on American Express,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible, uh, I kind of like having them for, uh, gasoline purchases.|sd sd
B|Yeah, we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, you know. But,|aa sd %
A|Yeah. But other than that, uh, I, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|How, how do you look at counting credit cards?|qo
B|We just, uh, quit using them|sd
A|Well, that's,|%
B|And they got us in trouble, we took a loan and paid them all off. We keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, Visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|but other than that we don't use them anymore|sd
A|Well, that's kind of the way we were doing it's, uh,|sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing, it's just too much by the time you get,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.|sv
B|I know, isn't that funny?|aa bh
A|Yeah. And I give them, maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're, know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent. Sometimes, it's twenty-two percent interest.|ny % sd % sd sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid|b aa sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, uh, the, uh, American Express card with T I,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Huh.|b b
A|there's no,|%
B|Huh?|br
A|with the American Express card from T I, there's no, um, late fee,|sd
B|Uh-huh .|b
A|there's no, uh, interest rate,|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|you you either pay the thing off or they come get it. And it's turned into personnel and they come get you So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then,  some of the others do.|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to. Oh, yeah.|sd ny
B|Oh, you can?|br
A|You can use it like any other card,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, but, it, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month,|sd
B|Oh, I see, huh.|bk
A|and who knows how many people, are looking at those, uh, bills that come in, and those statements,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|you're not the only one.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh, you want to make sure that, uh, is that okay, is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and most of the time it is. But, most of the others I've sent back, I mean, all you get is card offers, *two utts I've got three card offers now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, Visa Gold and, uh, some, other bank, uh,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out. And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one,|sd sd
B|Oh, I do too, I don't even open them much, I throw them out.|aa sd sd
A|I don't want to have to mess with it. You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, one of these days it's going to all be full.|sd
B|A girlfriend of mine found a, it was a Visa or MasterCard, she found an ad for one in like a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, that's not bad.|ba
B|shoot I need one of those|sd
A|Yeah. No, if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away. years ago, well, I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for, *sd oh, probably fifteen years,|b ^h sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|and then they started charging, uh, annual membership fees, and I said, adios, I'm, you know, I'm not paying you,|sd sd
B|Why do they do that?|qw
A|It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell.|sv
B|I mean, I mean they get enough, you know, on the interest|sv
A|I mean, they've been, Well, sure. And they, I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards, they're going to get cards at the , twenty bucks a pop.|% ba sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|There's going to be that much more.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, so, then a couple years ago I found, uh, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card, so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, I, it would be okay,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Huh.|b b
A|but I can't see paying someone to use their card.|sv
B|No, I can't either.|aa aa
A|Be charged their eighteen percent interest, Yeah,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think you're right. The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere.|sv sv
B|Yeah, really.|aa aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|gets a lot of people in, in trouble|sv
A|Yeah, it sure does. Maybe they're counting on that, I don't know. Well, I guess that's it.|aa aa sv h sd
