B|They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Why?|qw
B|Um, well, uh, partly due to ownership. You know, uh, Victor Kiam owned the, uh, the Patriots uh, for a period of a number of years|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. And it recently was sold to, uh, some other people so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, uh, keep, uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah. Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway  to see what happens now you,|b sv
B|Oh, yeah. I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before.|b sd

B|Wow!|ba
A|It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently|aa sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno|sd
B|Do you,|%
A|and he is for the L, the, uh, Raiders. L A Raiders,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Do you follow professional sports at all?|qy
A|Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well but I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to.|na sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I never knew very much at all so I'm trying|sd sd
B|Well, it's a good past time, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Particularly football. They say, uh, football attracts more men because of the, you know, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the field and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their frustrations by watching football and, you know, they get together with a bunch of guys and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, I guess, or something about the, uh,|sv sv sv sv sv sv
A|So I shouldn't even try to do it, huh|qy
B|Well, no. It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, uh, of a contest.|nn sv
A|Yes.|b
B|I think that, uh, I personally like hockey better because it has contact, it's a contact sport. It has the speed.|sv sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey.|sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So we, and that's, we're a big hockey area up here, I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in, in the Minnesota area|% % % sd sv
A|Really .|b

B|No, there's no hockey, there's no|nn sd sd
A|Nobody talks about it so I don't think we do.|sd sv
B|There's no professional hockey teams in, in Texas|sd
A|No, uh-huh. And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much, so.|b b sd sd %
B|Yeah. I think though that professional football in particular, is becoming so diluted now.|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like they have this World Football League. You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League but, uh, now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from, there's a team in London and there's a team  there, there's, uh, teams, other European teams|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and there's teams in the United States and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really you know, overkill|sd sd sv
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|And there's only so much football you can watch.|sv
A|Yeah. Well, I like to do, I don't like to watch.|b sd sd
B|Yeah, that's good.|b sv
A|I don't like to watch anything. So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an,  excuse to do nothing and I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the  guys get together|sd sd sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that's kind of cool. That's fun, you know.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it can get really overdone.|sv

A|Right. And that's the thing, you know.|b sv
B|You go, you know three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up, we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.|sd sd sd sd
