A|Okay, uh, I was just trying to think about how I, how I dress for work, you know, T I is a very casual atmosphere.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits and, uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one Because it doesn't seem like people are really, you know, are that alive on Monday, you know, so.|sd sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then progressively through the week, I'll, I'll wear nicer looking things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that. Uh, but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like, but.|sd sd sd %
B|Yeah, uh, you know, that's a good way to approach it. I've never thought about, um, I do plan my clothes a week in advance. Actually, I plan them a month in advance. I usually do a month at a time, so I don't repeat an outfit.|b sv sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, um, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday, because really no one's paying attention. But anyway, um, I really, I don't work outside of school. Um, I work in the computer lab at school so I can just wear whatever I have on for school, an, and, um, and really it's, I try to dress presentable but very comfortable.|sd sd sd sd % sd
A|Right.|b
B|Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants. I usually, uh, you know, college is so casual, you really don't want to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that, so.|sd sd % sv sv sv %
A|Right. Like where I work, it's, it's pretty casual, uh, it's, it's, I guess it's more like a, a college campus also, I mean there's you know, hundreds of people work for T I.|aa sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the time and they dress up like when customers are coming in,  or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that. And, uh, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their, the real, uh, higher ups,  like the the, the T I lawyers, and, uh, those that work for the, the higher executives, those secretaries. They, uh, they really dress up all the time.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
A|So there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know|sd
B|Well that's good that they're so casual.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, uh, my brother works for T I and he's a computer programmer, or computer engineer.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|And, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to having to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday. But, uh, he goes to work in his blue jeans, t-shirt,  and tennis shoes,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he just loves it.|sd
A|And that's very acceptable at T I.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I believe at I B M they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.|sd
B|That's what I've heard.|aa
A|Uh-huh, I I would hate to be in that atmosphere.|b sd
B|But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building, he calls it the new building. I don't know, it's where all the executives are.|sd sd h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, and so they were, they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the, all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans. But, he just left for Italy today at four,|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Over in T, I mean for T I but over in Italy.|sd
A|Yeah, oh, T I is everywhere.|b sd
B|Oh, yeah, he was so excited about going.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it|sd
A|That's true, that's a good idea.|aa sv
B|Because, uh, he just, he didn't, you know, he's not really into all that. He would wear it if he had to for his job and all but, you know, if he had the preference, I mean his, his preference is, um, blue jeans and a t-shirt, so.|sd sd sd sd %
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I think that's great about T I, and also, uh, to get off the clothing, the smokers, you know, how they have the,  the different designated areas for smokers and stuff.|sv sd
A|The, no, Right.|% % b
B|I think that's great.|sv
A|Yeah, and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke, smoke area and you don't smoke, you almost strangle.|aa sd
B|Oh, really. Do you smoke?|b qy
A|So much smoke in the air. Yeah, areas, the smoking area, you know, it's closed in,|sd ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and if you if you don't smoke and you go in there, everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when, when you go in there. I used to smoke a long time ago.|sd sd sd sd
B|I think that's, um,|sv
A|I used to burn my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes. That's one of the reason that I stopped|sd sd sd
B|Well, um, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college. Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and, uh?|sd qy %
A|Yeah, she always had, uh, yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes.|ny sd
B|See that's how, that's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and so,|sd sd %
A|No, I, I wasn't either, she, my daughter, she's real good at finding sales though, you know.|aa sd sd
B|Oh, me to, boy I have  to, hunt them down|sd sd
A|she'll buy a lot of,  yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know,  and, uh, just have them for the next year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she, you know, she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and, uh, buys clothes. Uh, you know, when they were coming up, I, I didn't sew, but now I've, I've learned how to sew, so I'm, well I'm, I'm still learning how, but I'm and I'm getting much better at it and I,  I'm going to be able to make my own clothes.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|That's great. I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet, but that, I mean, that can really benefit.|ba sd sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|Um, that's something that I'd be very interested in, very interested in learning.|sd
A|Right, because clothes are are really expensive. You know,|aa sv
B|Uh, they're outrageous!|sv
A|uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you can make for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric,  boy, runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah it's,  it's marked up.|b sv
A|Just a little shell to go under a suit, you know.|sd
B|It is, it is really outrageous but, uh, I mean like whenever I, I was growing up and all, my mom, I never understood this then, but I do now, but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars, or,  um, or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that|sv sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week.|sd sd
A|Right, especially to pay that kind of money for it.|aa bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I have a friend who, uh, she had a, she had a a little boy and, uh, she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus. I mean,  she dressed him, uh, fabulously.|sd sd sd sd

A|And then, seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she finally learned that you just can not do this, you know. *can not cannot So now she finds the basement sales and, just like, you know, everybody else.|sd sd
B|That's the best way to shop. I mean, I always thought my mom was being mean to me but I look back at it now and my child is going to, I mean, I'm going to raise mine the same way.|sv sd sd sd sd

A|Yes, and you,|aa %
B|I try to, uh, always catch the sales.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Always|sd
A|And, yeah, and you just have to keep buying them, you know. If you, if you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the, the quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.|b sv sv
B|Yeah, it, it depends on, um, yeah, there's, there's always a reason why they're on sale|aa sv % sv
A|Right.|b
B|So that, that has a lot to do with it.|sv

A|And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know, it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it and I just thought it was so pretty and I I got it at a real good price, I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And it was so pretty, and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why, why it was,  it was so cheap.|sd sd
B|Uh, oh.|ba

B|Oh, no.|ba
A|wasn't a seam or anything, you know.|sd

A|And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really noticeable, like she was moving the uh, from the outside, but, but still, it's, you know, it's really not, not, not a good quality. And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.|sd sd sd
B|The defect.|bf
A|Yeah, yeah, um, they don't really buy the first quality, they buy the second. And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds, they'll send them back every time.|aa aa sd sd sd sd
