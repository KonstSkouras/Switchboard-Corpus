B|Well, Hal, what's, uh, what's crime like in Dallas?|qw
A|Well, it depends where in Dallas you are.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because it's the situation it is very location dependent|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there are parts of town here where, when they talk about the nightly gunfire.|sd
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah, in Baltimore we have similar. Uh, I live on the outskirts of Baltimore and, uh, we live right outside the city and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people, though I'm in graduate school, uh, I live here because it's close to the university.|aa aa sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, you know, we have, uh, it, it's really funny, the only crime we really see is, uh, just the kids being malicious.|% sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, and I think most of that is because their parents aren't around. That make sense?|sv fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|That, uh, the, what they call the latchkey children.|bf
B|Yeah, something like that. No one's, you know, or, or fathers are just missing, you know, so there's no, uh, no consistency there in the home or whatever. There's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong, you know.|b h % sv sv sv
A|Yeah. The sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class so I think our, uh,|b sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|but on the other hand, uh, we get the, uh, affect of the, uh, the city and, uh, the main crimes within the suburb here are the, the theft crimes. A small number of assaults,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, well, if we have one murder a year that's probably as many,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but then, you know, you go into Dallas and they are, unfortunately uh, having murders at a rate greater than one a day.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's, we're about the same in Baltimore. Though, uh, Washington, I think is, uh, close by and, you know, they experience a lot more.|b b b sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think they definitely have more problems that, uh, in, in the area. What, what do you think can prevent crime?|sd qw
A|Well, the thing is, I don't, it's one of those things where, if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like, uh, wherever there are more, uh, criminals, there are more policemen|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but that's which came first.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|But, on the other side of it is it's, it's basically the, the problem is within the, in the society and the society's views|% sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, well, uh, since now I'm in my mid-forties, when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area I thought, you know, crime was, was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the, the drug *new slash unit? aspect of, uh uh, the pushers, the dealers and the addicts, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, Uh-huh. Yeah, I, I, I think, I agree with you there.|b b b aa aa
A|Because it just was not, uh, something back in the sixties that uh, I even had to worry about.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think, you know, that there is a lot in the society where things have changed, uh, so it's effected all of us.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, I think they, the drug culture definitely has, uh, is one of the main problems. Yeah, Because it would eliminate the, uh, the violence and the, uh, the the, the market, I guess, the, the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it. *sv|b b sv %
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|That make sense? He's one of the big proponents of that. He gets on national television and, and says that, you know. So it's, uh and he was a a District Attorney before, and a prosecutor before becoming, becoming mayor. So that's a really you know, it's a different viewpoint. I, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd % sd sv sv %
A|You know, in a sense I don't, I'm I have real mixed feelings on that|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because it comes a bit from the angle that the, uh, uh, it would certainly be an interesting test|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but the other side of it, to me,|%
B|What happens if we lose worse.|qh
A|Uh, well, the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side, and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I'd say, you know, back then there were the opium dens|% % sd
B|Right.|b
A|but the thing is, if somebody ruined their life, uh, society didn't try to then save themselves from it, they let this person who had ruined it uh, become, well, die or whatever.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short,|sd
B|Right, yeah.|b b
A|but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise, we need to take care of people even if they have, you know, physically ruined themselves.|sv sv
B|Yeah, they have induced it themselves.|aa sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
A|and so, to me that's, I, uh, I would certainly like to see a real test of, of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them. Uh-huh.|% sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well I think you know, they did that in Alaska. That, that actually, Alaska just recently legalized marijuana. *two utts But I never, I never heard results or anything like that, so I never, you know, plus, that's such a, that's not a true, uh, you know, it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country.|b b sd sd % sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, so that, but that was interesting, you know, I, I don't, crime is one of those things that's, uh, I, I don't know, you know, the drug culture, the, uh, the, uh, you know, I, I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things, not thinking anything wrong with it.|sd % % h % % sd

A|And so they|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|in the, there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties, but nowadays, there's so much on TV where, where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing. Of course uh, I work for lawyers a lot|% sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I see, unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars you can have uh, for mental duress or whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah|b b
A|But, you know, the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the, uh, in Europe, they seem to have mentality, and drunk driving is a good one, is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.|sd % % sd
B|Right.|aa
A|And, yeah, if you're going to drink, and you may drink, you better have your designated driver. And we mean it.|% sv
