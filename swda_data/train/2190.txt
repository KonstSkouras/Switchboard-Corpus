It's, uh, the, the chemicals we were dealing with were, uh, a Raid repellent and, uh, that was really quite dangerous, I'm not certain that that was, that, that's really a pollution issue.

That seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether, when they replace it, you know, they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad.|sd sd sd sd % sd
