B|All right.|b
A|Do you exercise, uh, during the day time or go to a gym or anything?|qy
B|Oh. Yeah, I, I used to go to a gym, um, last summer, but then I started school again, so, it's, um, so I don't exercise as much as I'd like.|b ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I, I do enjoy, um, going to a gym and working out, or just like, I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up, and I ride a exercise bike a lot. So.|sd sd sd %
A|Uh-huh. Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's really weird, because I'll get down on the floor, and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki, I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises, now. And she can be upstairs in the bedroom, and I don't know. She knows what I'm talking about. You know, pretty soon, here she comes. So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.|sv sd sd sd sd h sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I had a problem with my back, so, when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
A|So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then, then my back gives me a problem again.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So I try to do it every night, and uh.|sd %
B|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|Yeah, it seems like it's, you know, I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it you know,|aa % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so you know it's got to be good for you.|sv
B|Right|b
A|But, um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So, I was kind of thinking about joining it, but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it does really make you feel good, and I like to bicycle, too.|sv sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.|sv
B|Yeah, it does. Yeah.|aa aa aa
A|So.|%
B|I enjoy that a lot. I, um, bike in the summer. I belong to a biking club here in Kenosha.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, we go on a, like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|So I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, you know, can be in shape .|sd
A|Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, huh?|b qy
B|No, huh-uh. No, I go with my dad. He exercises a lot more than I do, though.|nn nn nn sd sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Oh, yeah, he's  always exercising.|ny sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|But, I'm not that energetic|sd

B|I get lazy sometimes.|sd
A|Yeah, well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know, and, um.|b sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.|qy
B|Oh, yeah, that's what I like to do.|ny sd
A|You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape, and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape  you know.|sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|aa aa
A|So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know|sd
B|Oh. Wow|b ba
A|So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.|sd
B|Oh, yeah, that is neat|b ba
A|You know, so. Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising. I wish I knew how to swim, but I don't, so I don't go swimming.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, um, I don't swim much, neither.|b sd
A|Uh-huh, but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you you know, for every part of your body.|b sd
B|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
A|So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that. If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there, but they don't have a pool in this small city, either.|sd sd sd
B|Oh. Um.|b
A|So. Well, listen then, it's been nice talking to you.|fc fc
