A|Okay so,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc %
B|First how much television watching do you do?|qw
A|I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I like it just for the noise|sd
B|That's right, but do you actually watch it, pay attention to it|b qy
A|Um.|b
B|or is it more of a company?|qrr
A|Um, it just depends on what it is.|b ^h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I have my favorite things that I do,|sd

B|Right.|b
A|Um, what about you?|qo
B|Well, actually, I work full time and when I am not working I am running and I do not watch a lot of television and I am very selective in what I watch.|^h ^h sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off. I probably watch television four hours a week, max.|sd sd
A|Well see that's great, yeah.|ba %
B|And, and, uh,|%
A|Well,|%
B|if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on. I would rather listen to music.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us and we do not know where that influence came from.|sv sv sv
A|Well, I think that, well, part, I think that's partially true, too.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think you have to have the will and the, and, uh, anyway, I think it,|sv %
B|Uh, right, right, right.|aa aa aa
A|you are, you would be susceptible to stuff.|sv
B|Of course, I, uh,|%
A|And it has to be reinforced at another level too.|sv

A|Do you like specials?|qy
B|Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. Those are fascinating to me.|na sd
A|Oh.|b

A|Oh|b
B|I hate that. I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor.|sd sd
A|Oh, right, yeah.|b b
B|In our comedy programs, although, nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can, but I would prefer to find, a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians.|sd sv sv
A|Well, we have cable also,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and sometimes you can, um, get the H B O specials, and sometimes those are really, pretty hysterical.|sd sv

A|so, yeah,|%
B|Well|%
A|I like to be entertained, I really do|sd sd

A|Oh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.|sd
A|She got you a|bf
B|Absolutely, I do not know who she thought she was, but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice, and that attitude being demonstrated.|aa sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.|sd
A|Oh, well, see that's,|%

B|I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES, and I always thought that was just casual slap stick, comedy,|sd sd
A|I hate that show|sd
