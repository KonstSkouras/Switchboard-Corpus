A|You know,  E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but,  um, not E D S, T I, um,|sd
B|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b

B|Right.|b
A|yeah. I mean,  I don't know,|% h
B|It's,|%

B|Right. Yeah, that, and I know that's a big issue because I, I belong to a women's forum group.|b b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And some of the questions we're getting are, are on site day care and things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That they consider a very serious benefit. And I can't tell you anybody right now at T I that's, uh, considering that.|sd sd
A|Oh, I don't, I would, think so, yeah because,|% sd % %
B|They should be though.|sv
A|Yeah, they really should because they're big enough, um, and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at, I think, right now than, that we have day care, um, they, uh, the health, the health program like T I has Texans?|aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|But it, I don't think it, that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean if you ever walked into E D S health, corner court health clubs on site and you walk into Spring Creek, well, Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway|sv

B|Yeah, a lot better. E D S is is better than Spring Creek?|aa sv qy^d
A|Oh, it's really nice, yeah.|sv ny
B|Oh, man.|ba
A|You know, instead of like six, um, treadmills, you've got like twenty.|sv

A|And E D S can't even compare in size. In terms of the number of employees.|sd

B|Oh, I see.|b
A|And T I doesn't have anything like that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, so I guess I, I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so,|%
B|That's good. That's a, that's a fortunate benefit, you know, that they're so active for their employees.|ba sv

A|Um, I don't know. I, I guess I also wish that, uh, companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews.  Yeah,|h sv
B|Yeah. Me, too. Me, too, because, you know, with utilities and, and homes that are, uh, price of homes have went up drastically. Like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand.|b aa aa sd sv sd
