A|Oh.|b
B|So how do you dress?|qw
A|Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now.|oo_co_cc
B|Okay.|aa
A|Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it and I wore heels anyway|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And,|%
B|I, I can see, I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,  it was tiring.|sd sd sd
A|I know, it might kill you to go up and  walk up to the door|aa bf
B|That's right.|aa
A|but you're going to look nice for the kids|bf
B|That's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?|aa qy

A|So, um,|%
B|Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know, it has a heel on it. They're the kind of boots that I wear to work and we wear them, you know, they're a leather boot that you wear and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things. Uh, it's kind of a, I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots. They're not a cowboy boot, but they're just a real pretty boot, but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.|sd
A|Sure. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Huh. Well, um,|b b b b %

B|But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know,|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|and, uh, that's very seldom we, it depends upon our winter. We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know, but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much. We often laugh about even when it turns chilly. We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
