B|Oh, it's not pretty old.|sv
A|No, uh, well, I I had an eighty-eight that I really liked and it got wrecked, and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my eighty-eight and I've had a lot of problems with this one, so,|aa sd sd sd sd %
B|So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?|qy
A|Well, you, it's, it's kind of funny, um, I know a lot,|% ^h sv
B|Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together,|sv
A|Oh. Yeah.|b b
B|so.|%
A|It's, it's true, it's definitely true because,|aa aa
B|But, but that's one reason I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru, that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh, for, you know, low maintenance, so.|% sd sv %
A|Yeah, well, Honda does too that's why I was really,|aa sv
B|Well, really, there's, there's no question but you have a nineteen, I mean, I've got to see if , I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, uh, like, uh, eighty-one or eighty, uh, Celicas,|b sv % % sd

A|No,|aa
B|so,|%
A|not at all.|aa
B|but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .|sv
A|Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, because I had, uh, uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda, and it was the worst car I've ever owned|aa sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda it was just a wonderful car and then it got wrecked and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car|sd sd sd sd

A|I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want, and I really have had a lot of problems with it, but I don't know.|sd sd h
B|Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody|sv
A|Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month, it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months|sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I don't know what you, normal, I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type. I, I'm not sure how to explain it,|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|no, what Astro, Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that,|ar % sd
B|Oh, okay, yeah .|bk %

B|Do you have, uh, do you have a family?|qy
A|Yeah, I have a couple kids|ny sd
B|Okay, well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit .|bk sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The only gripe I have is performance. I probably, uh, a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X sevens and stuff and they're, they're pretty fun to drive, so, so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around, I keep, I keep holding off|sd % sd sd sd
A|Yeah. Oh, really?|b bh
B|and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to but I just, I, it's just such a huge expense and, and, uh, I, I'm just going to keep holding off but I'm definitely going to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, you know,|sd % sv sd sd
