A|and,|%
B|I think today the thing that I, uh, would appreciate the most, uh, because my husband gets, his medical through his company, but we have to pay for mine|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're the only one, I'm the only one that's being insured and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has, I mean,|sd sd
A|Oh, is that right?|bh
B|so it's kind of,|sv

B|Right, it goes up. Right.|b ^2 b
A|So, yeah, I guess what, the other benefits that, uh, that I, uh, that I miss, I guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company, you know|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and course, these days, you can't count on that because|sv
B|Right.|b
A|uh, you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, uh, G M deal there in in Arlington|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and I'm sure it will be, you know, quite a few people are affected by that so,|sv %
B|Right, it's going to hurt the city, although, uh, I will personally tell you, I used to work at a bank, and I would see the G M people come in when they were, they would shut down to retool.|aa sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They were paid that whole time and I don't know, if you're aware of this|sd qy^d

A|Is that right?|bh
B|I, I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked.|sv
A|The union, yeah.|b^m aa
B|And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck. I just read this in the paper the other day.|sd sd
A|Is that right?|bh

A|Yeah.|b
B|but I don't feel as sorry for them,|sd
A|Well|%
B|If my husband  were laid off tomorrow, we'd get one more check|sd

A|Yeah, really the ones it's going to hurt is, is actually the, the businesses around in that area.|b sv
B|Yes. Oh, yeah, that's already hurting.|aa aa sd
A|You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that, uh,|sv
B|But I think there's a case, where benefits have gotten, they voted them in and they got so good, I mean, like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical, all these things, you know|sv sd sd
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|and it made the prices of cars go up and and, you know, the,|sv %
