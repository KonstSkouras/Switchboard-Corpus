B|Well, uh, the, with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them and so I found another baby-sitter and she was wonderful except I thought that there were too many in the home and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care. She was wonderful, it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home. It was in home child care.|% sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent and, uh, I could go back to work.|sd sd sd sd
