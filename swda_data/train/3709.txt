B|All right. Uh, exercise huh|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings. I belong to Presidents.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I do, I do a combination of, uh, uh, running and weight training|sd
A|They set that up for you.|qy^d
B|No, I, uh, actually I just, uh, joined on my own and I have been thinking about getting with a, uh, one of their counselors just so see what, uh, they might have to offer as far as, uh, alternatives.|nn sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I pretty much, uh, worked on my own routine.|sd
A|And, uh, what kind of running do you do?|qo
B|They have got the track on the inside.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then after that, I work out with weights.|sd
A|Is is just aerobics or,|qy %
B|Uh, I work out with free weights.|sd
A|No, uh, I mean the running.|ar sd
B|Oh, uh, yeah. It is really the, uh, aerobic work out part.|ny sd
A|You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less?|qy
B|Uh, about seven minutes.|na
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, uh, out of breath.|b b qy
B|Uh, no I do|nn sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|Yeah, that is, that is a pretty good clip and I am pretty winded by the time I get done.|b sv sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So,|%
A|But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to make six or something like that.|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah. I, I, uh, could probably go faster, but then I would wear myself out|ny sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah. How about you?|b qo
A|Yeah, I, I don't run much any more. I did when I was in school.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right now I just lift, uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and I, uh, jump rope a little bit|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that is about it|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, uh, they are about a third of my body weight.|sd sd
B|Oh, I see. So this, uh, do you just try and keep them, I guess, uh, firm and, uh,|bk % qy
A|Yeah and uh, uh, I play the trumpet and the, uh, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play.|ny sd sd
B|Yeah, uh, that is true.|aa aa
A|You have to do a whole lot of sit ups and, uh, and then, uh, I hurt my neck, uh, about three years ago.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, uh, hurting yourself when you play high.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|You have to, you have to do it correctly, you know, it is like an exercise in itself, but a lot of people, uh, strain themselves doing it.|sd sd sd
B|Oh, I see. Uh, so you are in, uh, in part of a band?|b qy
A|Uh, I play at Church.|na
B|Oh, I see, I see I use to play an instrument when I was in high school, but it wasn't the trumpet|bk bk sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something. I think,|sd %
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?|qy
A|Well, yeah, uh, well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know I mean in Dallas.|ny sd
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|Yeah. I keep thinking about it, but that doesn't mean it gets done. I, I mostly jump rope more.|b^m sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know.|b
B|Yeah, I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, uh, when I was, uh, well a while back I was more into basketball|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, but, it has been a while since I have done that.|sd
A|Yeah. I do a toe lift and squats for that.|b sd
B|Right.|b
A|But you know it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't, uh, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something at, uh, uh, great length of time.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, I, I, uh, that is true. I have noticed that, uh,|b aa aa sd
A|And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, then it doesn't bother me very much.|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah. Huh. That is interesting though. Uh, I have been thinking of changing, uh, I have done the same routine for almost two years now and I am thinking of, uh, changing it up.|b b ba sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, uh, get out of the routine.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I am looking at changing things a little bit.|sd
A|Yeah, that is, uh, I have started doing more push ups and, and it has helped a lot and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out.|b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't try to push it so the end in one set.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
