B|Yeah, it's um, it's very hot, in fact I've been cleaning, because I live in an apartment|b sd sd
A|Oh, okay,|b
B|so I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening um, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I have the little flower boxes with, um, a a lot of different flowers, and I do enjoy plants, but I don't have a yard or anything that I can do gardening, really.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, you're, you're, you're not the so-called you need a house, I guess, to go through all of that. I have had a couple of houses, and, uh the only recommendation I would have for someone who hasn't gardened is, uh, one, get a couple of good books, of books, of course,|% sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and usually they have talk shows.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Here in Dallas they have two great, uh, talk shows that go through everything that will grow here, which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are|sd
B|Uh-huh. Right, right.|b b b
A|and so. Uh in fact, you, you could easily do that now, listen to, turn on a talk show up there and see if there, there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in, and, and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything,|sv
B|Yes, but,|b %
A|so I, uh, for someone who doesn't garden, I'd say, that, that's my biggest recommendation is to,|% sv
B|Uh-huh, so you enjoy gardening?|b qy
A|Oh, yeah, yeah. I like it a lot, uh uh,|ny ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's a lot of work. I'm an engineer, I'm, I'm with T I. You, are you with T I up there or,|sd sd sd % qy %
B|No, no, I'm with a defense contractor.|nn nn sd
A|Okay. Uh, where was, oh, yeah, no, I, I like it, I, uh, I always know that why I'm not a farmer when I garden though, I mean, it is dog work, and it is tough|bk t1 % nn sd sd sv sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|I have a lot of trees, down here, uh, the part I don't like, I guess, would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves forever it seems like,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours, so other than that, you know, those three months, when it's pure dog work uh, the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of, of putting little plants in or whatever|sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|I, I haven't had to plant any trees because I've got so many, but, uh uh, but I do listen to that talk show.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There, there is some great people from Texas A and M, I don't know, maybe you've heard of A and M down here, but there's some great, uh, folks, uh that have been well trained, and, again, uh, to, to, uh, recommend gardening for this area.|sd h qy^d sd
B|Uh-huh. Um. Yeah, I'm sure it is, you know, different in the different areas. Um, I'm originally from Pennsylvania, and I do go home on weekends during the Summer and, uh, and, uh, mow my mother's grass and different things like that.|b b sv sd sd
A|Yeah, you probably have rye grass up there. We grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here.|b sv sd
B|Oh, I would have no idea|sd
A|Right, yeah, see, you would have to learn that, though, see|b % sv %
B|No idea whatsoever. Like I said, I'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill,|sd sd
A|Um.|b
B|and,|%
A|Do you have much luck in the Winter, or they're, they're freeze it, freeze out because the roots are all, in the Winter, uh, or do you have to start all over every year?|qy qrr qy
B|Yeah, I have to start all over every year|ny sd
A|Right, yeah,|b %
B|well, except, I do have some, um, some day lilies that um, you know, I don't do anything with|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they seem to come back year after year, and I leave them on my balcony even in in the snow and the Winter, you know in the ice, everything, because here, you know, not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania,|sd sd
A|In the same pot, that's amazing. Uh-huh.|^2 ba b
B|but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that.|sd
A|Yeah, I grow a few things in pots, but we have to bring them in here in the Winter because usually, uh, if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know, the pots will, will die,|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|everything in a pot will die|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, you can bring them, well, we do bring stuff in the garage and everything|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, it's quite time consuming, by the way. I don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything, but it's quite, uh. But I would definitely do it, I'm all for doing everything, whether, whatever subject you pick, do it the knowledgeable way|sd sd % sv sv % ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|don't go out there and start digging holes, uh,|ad
B|Right, right, I agree with that.|aa aa aa
A|Get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia as, as well as,|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|not your neighbors, of course, they usually know nothing then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications, as well as, I bet there's a talk show up there right now that you, if you turn the dial around you'll,|sv sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah, Uh-huh.|b % b
A|on Saturday, this is Saturday, that you'll find someone, probably in the morning, I don't know discussing, you know, what we do up in Virginia to get something growing|sd sd % sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|you probably don't have to do much over there, the soil's probably so good|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|our soil's not very good down here. We're|sv %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess in the ice age, it, it, it's pushed a lot of, uh, limestone and everything, to some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone, you know|sv
B|Wow, uh-huh.|ba
A|so, uh, I think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees, where people have come from, I'm sure the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas, it's so scrubby uh,|sv sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from Alabama and all that, too|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we, we call them native pecan trees but, they grow wild here, they're eating pecans though Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia, they're probably only in the South for pecan pie and all that,|sd sd sd sv sv

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|sometimes they do essentially nothing, and the weather men yesterday were all alert, say, hey, there's something really terrible going to happen, and they, they sure were right, but it wasn't in Texas, it was north of us.|sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|That, that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down, uh,|sv

A|uh, and again as I said, I think the, when the Indians were here there, there weren't any trees, but the, the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees, and a lot of them have done well|sv sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, they do have some pine forest areas in in in east Texas where you have native pine trees,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
