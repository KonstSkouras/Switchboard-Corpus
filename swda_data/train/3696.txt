A|Um, well, it wasn't that big of a family, but, um, it just got out of hand, and, um, so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and, and, um, how much, um, beverages we were going to need and this and that, and oh, it just grew and grew and grew, and, um, when the time came, only about half that amount of people came. So, it wasn't, you know, you have to really just get an accurate amount, and, but overall we all had a good time. We saw people we hadn't see in a while so,|sd sd sd sd sd % sd % sd sd %

A|My, uh, my grandmother in California is, um, this is my dad's part, side of the family is planning a reunion, um, this spring, but we won't be going because, um, I don't know how they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise, and, um, it seems like most of the family is, uh, going, you know, all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are, most of them are going, but it's too costly for us. But anyway, they're going to go on a cruise, and, um, it sounds really neat, it really does.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, I, I can go for that. What, what do, I guess interesting if you had a, a, a very extended family that, that kind of involved a lot of people that cousins and things that you don't really know, that you've never met, it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people.|aa sd % % sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|Uh, I don't know how you would go about, uh, getting them together, but that, that would be, uh.|sd sv
A|And a friend of mine, um, she plans her family reunion, um, every year, and they go camping, and she says they have the greatest time, and she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person, but she said they all go camping, and they have a really good for the whole weekend.
