B|Yeah, Yeah, yeah, he does.|aa aa aa sv
A|Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy look,|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, that's my field of work also.|sd
B|Oh!|b
A|So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this and I heard about it, so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, uh, You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth.|sd sd sd
B|Oh. Right.|b b
A|We could go back to television shows.|oo_co_cc
B|Well, you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible?|qy
A|Yes, I have.|ny sd
B|I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true.|sd
A|Well, no. That's, uh, you could interpret it that way.|ar % sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth, but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Okay, so you can have, there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing. So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.|b sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that's, you know, you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true, but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.|% sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can look at it, you know, if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.|sv sv
B|I guess if you're looking for that, you're,|sv
A|Yeah, well, Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.|b sv
B|that, uh, Uh-huh.|% b
A|So,|%
B|Really.|b
A|But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.|sd
B|Yeah, that's right.|aa ba
A|But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, so, uh.|sd
B|Yeah. Surely we've made it.|b sv
A|I think so too. Let's just, it's been very pleasant talking to you,|aa ad fc
