A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Right.|b
A|but the bedrooms are too small. Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.|sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'd hate to clean these windows, I really would.|sd sd
B|I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean. Ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.|sd sd sd
A|Ours are those too, yeah. You must live in an older home too then.|sd b sd
B|Right, I do, the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old.|aa sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's not a new home, it's, it's seen some wear and tear. You know.|sd sd
A|Ours has too. When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he did it hisself, so most of that, by now, is falling apart.|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|You know, well I mean, it's not just horrible, but like this tile's come loose off the wall, the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and I don't like that at all.|sd sd sd sd
B|Um, that is awful.|ba
A|With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,  the, the huge one.|sd

B|The normal tiles, right.|^2 b
A|right that you put around a bathtub, that would be prettier.|aa sd sd

A|But this looks like floor covering on the wall. It just doesn't look good.|sd sd
B|Oh, and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.|sd sd
A|Right, there's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on, so.|b sd sd %
B|Um.|b
A|And he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there, and|sd sd %
B|Oh, wow, I, that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay. We don't have a, we don't have enough power, um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.|ba % sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful. There is there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,|sd sd sd
A|Um.|b
B|and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house, so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,  you know,|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we never know where it's going to flood.|sd
A|We've got power surges on the west side of our house. We've got our stereo hooked up.|sd sd

B|Well that's something, my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff. He, I mean, he'll do a little things but he won't do any major rewiring. He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.|ba sd sd % sd sd sd

B|Yeah, he must not of. We stripped ours, we stripped ours off. We didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on. And we completely completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.|aa sv sd sd sd
