A|So, do you, your privacy being invaded at any time?|qy
B|Well, uh, one of the things that, uh, that I found to be, uh, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill. That  is something that is not required|sv sv
A|Well, Right.|% b
B|and, in fact, uh, it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many people many people from, uh, from doing it. And it's one of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, uh, research. And to get your, your phone number on, uh, uh, lists for phone solicitations.|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah. Now that you can still, yeah, I've always done that. I started, once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do. You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then  that's fine.|aa aa % sd sd sd sd ^q

I, I've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state. Uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense. And people are looking for alternate ways of, uh, enhancing revenue is the, uh, phrase they use. And they were talking about selling the D M V lists and there was a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, consternation about that and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea. But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, uh, public that you, don't know about.|aa sd ^q sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sv
