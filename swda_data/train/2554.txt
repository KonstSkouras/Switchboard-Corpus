B|Well, um, most of the stuff up until now, in the recent months, I, I, I don't have any problem with.|sd
A|No, I don't either.|aa sd
B|Uh, I mean it's, you know it,|% %
A|I don't think it's going to change very much but|sv %
B|No, I agree with that. As, as far as the, as far as the mess that's developing as a result, um, you know, as a country, the United States, uh, I think our hands are tied as far as, as, as any further involvement,  until the U N sanctions it.|aa aa sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|In fact, it really was to begin with.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I just, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, uh, you know, it, it gets to a point where, uh, if enough people are, are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the, the internal problems, um, somebody may step in again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I really think it's, it's a U N issue,  at that point because it is internal.|sv
A|Yeah. Well, you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.|b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in, in Iraq, they're going crazy.|sv
B|That's right, that's right .|aa aa
A|You know, I mean you can't please them one way or the other.|sv
B|Absolutely right.|aa
A|You know, and I, and I think that, I, I agree with you, this is exactly the right course. I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq. It has nothing to do with us.|aa sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Um,|%
B|I mean these, these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time.|sv
A|All the time. I mean, yeah, I mean,|aa aa %
B|Some of them have been going on for, for tens of years,  if, if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and,|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.|b aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it's going to continue.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|As long as you have so many diverse groups that are, that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time.|sv
B|Yeah, that's absolutely right.|aa aa
A|I mean the Kurds have tried it before. They've gotten their butts kicked,|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and this is just another time that it's happening.|sv
B|That's, that's absolutely right.|aa
A|You know, they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years.|sv sv
B|Yeah, it was just, you know, it was, it's a very opportune moment for them to try. You know you,|aa % sv %
A|Sure, and, and, and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. You know.|aa sv
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, that would have been stupid,|% sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah, I agree.|aa aa
A|But it just, it, it really doesn't make any difference. This is just a, a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history.|sv sv
B|Yeah, and, you know, and it, there are many of them. There's no doubt about it.|aa sv sv
A|Oh, sure, I mean the, the British occupied the place, the French occupied it, we've done it. It, it's happened so many times, this is, this is really nothing special. Uh,|aa sd sd sd sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human rights or anything like that. It,   It's, it's religious based|aa sv sv
A|That's right, it's it's mostly religious anyway.|aa ^2
B|and, uh, you know, by, by self-proclamation this is a holy war and it is right.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then, uh, we, we go on from there and,|sv %
A|Yeah, exactly.|aa aa
B|Yeah, it, it's, it's a mess. It, it's, there's no doubt about it, and, uh,|b sv % sv %
A|Well, I, I, I think one of the big problems, I mean looking at it from the the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners.|sv sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|They don't understand what, I mean their politics really isn't politics. It's religion couched as politics.|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|aa aa
A|And there's a big difference.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|You know, uh, we sit there and, and we think that they think the way we think.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's a big mistake,  because they don't.|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, there's, there's different value placed on human life,  and, uh, right down the list, you know, possessions and, and everything else.|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|And, uh, what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.|sv
A|That's, that's it a lot of the time. I, I was stationed in, in Turkey for, for a year and a half.|aa sd
B|Okay.|b

B|Yeah Yeah.|b b
A|You know, it, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's just, it was very strange.|sd
B|I believe it.|ba
A|It was very interesting.|sd
B|Yeah, yeah, I can, I can, I can believe that. Yeah, I, I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means, but, uh,|aa aa ba aa sd %
A|Now I, shoot, I, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes.|% sv
B|That's probably true, that's probably true.|aa aa

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I'm not real sure that's, that's appropriate.|sv
B|No, no, that's, that's, uh, a, a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field.|aa aa % sv
A|No.|aa

B|Yeah.|b
A|And we make experts by reading books.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You know, and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing.|sv

B|Right, right, that's an everyday occurrence.|na na sd
A|Yeah. It's, it's like our car industry, the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese, you know, came into it and helped,  us out.|b sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I agree. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, there, there is, there is, it's an overall problem in, in, in this country understanding, uh, foreign cultures,  or even accepting them.|b b aa aa sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b

A|I mean looks who's, looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything.|sv

A|It's not us.|sv

A|His degree was in, uh, industrial engineering.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|Uh, and he's from the Philippines.|sd

B|Right.|b
A|He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs.|sd
B|Sure, okay.|b b
A|You know, uh, but I, I see it all too often. I mean we've got loads of foreign students|sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Absolutely.|aa

B|That's right.|aa
A|And I don't know, it's, to me it's amazing. I don't know what we're going to do as a country. We're, we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later.|h sv sd sv
