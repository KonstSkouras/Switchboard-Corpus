B|Uh, you, you're, you're in the roughest stages of pet  ownership, I think.|sv

B|Well. I don't, I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence, really, the, the, the training bit, uh. I've had dogs through the years. Right now I've got two, and three cats, but, uh, and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix, and we watched it this summer for two to three months, and it wasn't trained quite fully either|sv sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog.|sd
A|Yeah, so how'd you all, how do you, what's the best method?|b % qw
B|I don't know. I, I'm old fashioned, and when I got my, my dogs, when they, when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside.|h h sd
A|Right.|b
B|They say that's not the way to do it now. You're just supposed to|sv sv
A|Stand outside with them until they.|^2
B|No, just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you catch them in the act.|ar sv
A|Well, we're hardly ever at home, so it's kind of difficult,|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b

B|No, no, you don't want to do that, but, uh.|aa aa sv %
A|Yeah, we, we try to take it, you know, it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside and, you know  and then it runs right inside|b sd sv sd
B|Does, does it just want to sniff around? Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside?|qy qy
A|Yeah, a lot of times, and you know, it won't it's little job outside|ny sd sd
B|Yeah.|b

B|Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside?|qy
A|Uh, yeah, we've tried that, and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go,|ny sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, and he chews on plants and all that, but, you know, that's natural  for a little puppy. Huh?|sd sv
B|That's nothing, huh. Well, it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you. I, I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever, and she's gone the other way, because she's so old, she doesn't have much control|^2 sv sd sd sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|so we're battling with that problem|sd

A|Oh, of course not.|aa
B|so we're putting up with all her accidents,|sd
A|I couldn't.|sd
B|and the two nights ago, she had diarrhea, and so that was a bad one. But, uh, I think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend|% sd sd sd
A|That is really sad. What, what's the deal, we, we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, you know|ba qh sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and so it, I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, you know, tug on it to walk it. I mean, it just goes like a mad dog, I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping, and  it's, you know, I mean, it's not even close to even being trained on a leash.|sd sd sd sd
B|Does it, oh. Uh-huh. You know, maybe you you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.|ba b sv
A|Uh-huh. Well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know, they sometimes misuse their license or whatever you know,|b sd sv
B|Oh.|b
A|they treat them bad.|sv
B|Well, you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh

A|Oh, really?|bh
B|and, it, it, it's a pretty good class, and they did pretty good, except this dog is, she's just pretty, she's not smart|sv sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, she didn't learn a lot, but it, I think it calmed her down a little bit, and she's used to being around other dogs now.|sd sv sd
A|How long did it take?|qw
B|I think it was like a six week program.|sd
A|Every, what?|br
B|Uh, I think it was one night a week for like six weeks,|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|and, uh, you know, it was a group class, outside. It was fairly reasonable, too.|sd sv
A|Well, Sheltie Collies are, you know, timid, and they don't really, unless they get used to something, they're really nervous and.|sv sv sv %
B|Yeah, they're, they're usually, a high-strung dog aren't they?|b qy
