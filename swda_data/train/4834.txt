A|Right.|b
B|Uh, do you feel that yours is invaded?|qy
A|Uh, no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. Uh, you know, I would, there, there's a lot of times though, uh, you get those calls and, you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or, or whatnot and, you know, next thing you know, uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to, to tell them, you know, that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you, you know, and keep badgering you about it, and that aggravates me. But I don't know that you could call that invading of, invading my privacy because, you know, if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, you know, I want my name unlisted or want my, you know,|nn sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd h sd

A|She received a bill from them, uh, that she had visited some and, and I think it was there in Florida, maybe it was in Miami.

A|Huh.|b
B|Uh, if the purchase was made mail order, they should have a record of where it was shipped to|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her. Uh, if it was some you know, coming into the store and stuff, then she would whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of, uh, you know, document|sd sd
