A|The question was on lawn and garden work. Um, how do you like it?|sd qo
B|Well, I don't do much of it here. I'm from, uh, from, uh, Colorado originally and there are no bugs there. And I didn't mind getting in the dirt there, but, boy, I'll tell you what, once I see these bugs around here, I'm just kind of out of it.|arp_nd sd sd sd fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd

A|Oh, and I know somebody that lives there, and they never mentioned that problem|sd sd
B|Oh, you're kidding, you're kidding. No, it's a well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here. And, uh,|bh % % sv %
A|Oh, my. They probably just take it for granted then.|ba sv
B|It must be. If they lived here, a lot of people I know just say, oh, I just stomp on them. It doesn't matter. They make good fertilizer in the garden.|aa sd ^q ^q
A|Oh, yuck|ba
B|Me, personally can't,|sd
A|I don't have that problem, uh, it's, mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that, uh, I, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work.|sd % sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part, like putting in the annuals and things like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But I don't like, I don't like it dirty|sd
B|No I have to, you know I have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really|aa sd
A|No, I don't know. We got the, we got the question and I thought, oh, this is going to be interesting. Two bits I'll get a man to talk to me, because they get stuck doing it all. But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work. And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so, um, we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall.|b h sd sd ^q sd sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Today we just had a lot of rain|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah, so it's kind of nice. I don't know how yours has been.|ny sd qw^d
B|Well, it's been real hot here lately. I mean we've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything but, uh, it's supposed to rain again now, uh, this weekend.|sd sd % sd
A|Oh, I see.|bk
B|So, then,|%
A|Okay. Well, we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there,|bk sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity. But, um, as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know, uh, too much, too much about, uh, how much I really do enjoy it myself.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Do you like it at all?|qy
B|I, well, not here. I mean it's just, here I just can't stand to even get out in the, uh, in the dirt Just,|ng sd sd %
A|Well, how about when you were in Colorado?|qo
B|Well, I liked it a little bit but I didn't, uh, I was working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time, for that|sd % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so that I think really, um, hampered it a little bit.|sd
A|Well, and then, too, now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high. And, uh, if you have that on a regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off, you know.|sd ad
B|Yeah.|aa
A|But, uh, and with children, um, you probably don't have time anyhow to, to get into it.|qy^d
B|No. Not really|nn sd
A|It's so, uh, okay, very good.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter, since neither one is really into gardening, are we?|fc
B|Sounds like No, no. Afraid not. Uh, hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times Something I really know a lot about.|% fc fc fc fc
