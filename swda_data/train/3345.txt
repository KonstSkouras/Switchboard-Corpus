A|Well, you keep up with current events?|qy
B|Um, somewhat. Yeah, somewhat|na % na
A|Not,|%
B|not as well as I would like to probably|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|but that's the way it goes.|sd
A|Yeah, where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania.|b qw
B|What?|br
A|Where in Pennsylvania?|qw
B|Um, State College, I go to Penn State.|sd sd
A|Oh, do you, well, great.|bk ba
B|Yep.|b
A|How's, uh, well no, we're not supposed to talk about that. We're supposed to talk about current events.|% ar sd sd
B|Right, exactly, uh.|aa aa
A|Well, I'm a current event junkie. So I, I watch, I try to watch the news, and I read the newspaper, and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.|sd sd sd sd
B|I see. Well, what particularly are you interested in?|b qw
A|Well, I just, pretty, uh, little, you know, about everything. And, not and then again not everything,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening. Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, other than that, uh, I just, you know, just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and know, feel like I know what's going on.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|But I always have been|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I stay up with it. But, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware of most of the current events. Uh, newspaper? T V news, or what?|sd qo
B|Um uh, well, some of both.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I read, I read the newspapers sometimes|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally|sd
A|Right. Yeah, that's good.|b b ba
B|and I read magazines, and such.|sd
A|Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.|bf
B|Well, yeah, I mean, not, not that badly anyway,|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I am, I am interested in what's going on, and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh. Oh, you've been there|b b b bh
B|and, yeah.|ny
A|well, you would be interested in it then.|sv
B|Right, exactly.|aa aa
A|Yeah, uh, I follow it, you know, I don't just read everything about it, but I'm always aware of what's going on like that|b sd sd sd
B|Yep,|b
A|and, uh, because it is, it's interesting|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I don't know, I feel sorry for those people down there, they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,|h sd sv
B|That's true. They've never really had a good leader,|aa sv
A|I mean he was a terrible tyrant|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and I think it's been better since he died, but it's still been bad|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, uh, I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.|sd sd
B|Oh, yeah?|bh
A|Yeah, he was pretty, pretty much a, he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.|ny % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,|sv
B|I see. Uh-huh.|b b
A|but, uh, but then again, who, you know, those people are so used to it I guess it's the only thing that works.|% sv sv
B|Yeah, so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?|b qo
A|I think it's pretty darned good, I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really do. Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme, the media does, but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over, and I listen to the radio|sd sv sv sv sd
B|Right, right.|b b
A|so I, you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe|sv sv sv
B|Yep.|b
A|but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really don't.|sd
B|Yeah, well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better, but I,  would agree that it's pretty good.|b ar aa
A|I don't think so. I don't think our news could be better.|ar sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.|qh
B|Um.|b
A|I don't see anything that they could do.|sv
B|Yeah, well, I think that, um, I don't know.|b sv h
A|Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon|sv
B|The, um, Right.|% aa
A|I understand what you're saying,|ba
B|Right, I think that,|aa sd
A|But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.|sv
B|Well, that may be so, yeah.|aa %
A|Uh nothing is perfect.|sv
B|I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Well, that's true, I understand what you're saying, and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper, that's why we have C N N.|b aa ba sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
