A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so it's a pretty big reunion, it's about two hundred people, maybe.|sd sd
A|Oh, my word. Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?|ba qo
B|Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.|sd
A|Oh. Uh-huh.|bk bk
B|And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.|sd sd
A|Oh. Oh, that's good.|bk ba
B|And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh, and then did you have a main meal, or did everyone just bring, it was just pot luck.|bk qy % qy^d
B|It was kind of pot luck.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.|sd

B|Oh, yeah. My nickname for her is Honey Woman. That's what I call her.|b^m sd sd
A|Really. Well that sounds fun. Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago, and there were, we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there. And so that was a real challenge, and I was president of our family reunion for two years, and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row, but I found that advance planning was the key to success.|b ba sd % sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh, also one thing that's helpful, and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever|sv qy^d
