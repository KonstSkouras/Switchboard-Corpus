B|uh, actually I grew up in Alabama, and I went to see my mother, and then went on down to Disney World, and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon. And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, course this, grant it, that's, you know, it's been four years ago, but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh, my boss just bought a, a pick up truck, and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon.|% % sd sv sd sd
A|Yeah.|b

B|Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors, we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice. I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know, these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,|sv sd sv sd

A|Yeah. And then, uh, he talked about a van, and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these. And another thing was that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car, but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.|b sd sd sd sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|I think you need the thing around your waist, but, I think you need that bag to pop out too.|sv sv
