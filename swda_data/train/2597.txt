B|Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it, but,  but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,  it's such a big area|sd

B|Well, uh, I'll tell you something, um, I, I have a sister-in-law from Israel,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all. They, they believe that they, they belong there and they've belonged there forever, and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less, they, they consider them second class.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, they're really quite arrogant about it. I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.|sd sd
A|Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States intervening with Patriot missiles, did, did they,|qw %
B|Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|but, I didn't really talk about that with her. She, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, Switzerland.|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an, and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them, and they really treat them like second class citizens. They, they don't really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they, they really do, they look down on them. And, I don't know, being, I, I live in, uh, Vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black. We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.|sd sd % sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know, it's just like it's a dog eat dog world. And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs and they, they send their kids to school and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.|sd sd sv sd sd sd sd

A|Well I live in San Antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority.|sd sd
B|Oh, um, I talked to someone about San Antonio,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos, I don't know, do they call it the barrio down there.|sd h qy
A|That's the barrios but it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city. It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.|na sv sv
B|Yeah, but I heard that San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it it just has a really bad problem.|b sd
A|I grew up outside of Houston and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.|sd sv
B|Yeah, like say Houston. Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city.|b fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv

A|Yes there's quite a bit of crime.|ny sd
B|Oh, my, um, yeah, like I, we're so protected up here, it's, it's really strange. I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know,|ba b sv sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're just so protected. But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians. You know, the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd. Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.|sv sd sd sd sd sd
A|Huh.|b

B|To do it, yeah, but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise. And that's what they did and now they're like asking him for help and he's like, no we can't get involved.

B|Yeah, I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine. They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go, but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, and I mean, he, he's just,|aa sv sv ^q sv %

A|Yeah.|b
