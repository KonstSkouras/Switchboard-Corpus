A|Uh, I work at T I and we have, uh, of course, started drug testing, uh, random drug testing here and, uh, I haven't gotten called yet, but, uh, I feel that it's probably it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.|sd sd sd sv
B|Do they feel that way?|qy
A|Uh, I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I, but I think our latest statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were, uh, testing negative on all the on, on all the testing.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, I, I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to to the drugs.|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's, uh, I don't know, I don't really liken it to alcohol but, yet that can be carried to an extreme, too.|% h sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I think it's a good idea and I think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,|sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|I don't know that their job would be at risk, because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|I would think that, is that how they do it at T I maybe. That,|sv qy %
A|Right, I at T I, if you get called in and you test positive for drugs, then you're put on a program and, uh, you know, you go through the program and then you're called like six months after you complete the program|na % sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and if you test positive, then you're terminated.|sd
B|Well, I guess I, I draw a hard line but, you know, I would, I'm, I'm in favor of, of that type of thing.  That, uh, you, you have people out there that are responsible for certain things|sd sd
A|Yeah, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|and you expect them to do their job and it, it is possible that, you know, that they can't do as good a job, uh, as they might do.|sd sd
A|That's right. Uh-huh. Oh, and, of course they can also cause injury to other people.|aa b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|If they're, if they're not, uh, you know, fully functional mentally while they're doing their job. They could cause  you know, serious injury to   another people.|sd
B|Right, and you never know they could just go off the deep end   on, on a, on something  uh, that whatever  they're taking at the time|aa fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and, and it would be, uh, you know, out of the question.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Also, I guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.|sv
A|That's right. Oh yeah.|aa b
B|I sub in the schools|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I've, you know, had a, they they talk a lot about  drugs there|sd sd
A|So, Right.|% b
B|and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, you know, I think they can test all they want for drugs you know, and if they need to do that as a condition for employment|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I know many of them are doing it. I know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't know how many others are doing that and, and I think that's good  because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at  an early age|sd sv
A|Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's right.|aa b aa
B|and, uh, I don't know, it's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle I think.|h sv
A|Uh-huh. You know, I think personally I'm for it. There's several reason why I, I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing, they say, runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it.|b sd sd sd
B|Really?|bh
A|And,|%
B|It's that high?|qy
A|Yes. And, oh, yeah, it's very expensive.|ny ny sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|I didn't realize it was that expensive.|sd
A|Uh-huh. It's not like a normal urinalysis|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's very expensive to run them. And, uh, I didn't get a raise this year, because, nobody in our company got a raise.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, yet  they spend all the money on drug testing|sd
B|Just lucky to have jobs.|bf
A|and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, there, you know, there's different, I don't think that that's, that, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a, a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know that. But then, I have other views to it.|sd sd
B|I just, I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and Sam's and Wal-Mart are, are owned by the same people|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he took one for, for, uh, Wal-Mart for job hiring|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then Sam's called him and, and he took another one|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and I, you know, I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I can see if because, you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars they wasted.|sd sv
A|Theirs might not run a thousand dollars. *Their's Theirs Our, from what I understanding here at T I, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee.|sd % sd
B|Well, maybe they run, I don't know, you know, that's just guessing it. Maybe they run a lot of other tests, or maybe it's under a health type program that it it, it would catch a lot of things.|sd h h sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|I, I just can't imagine  them screening all these employees, paying a thousand dollars to get them.|sd
