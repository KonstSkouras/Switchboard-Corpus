B|Yes.|b
A|First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing . Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly. I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah, it, it.|b %
A|It doesn't seem like, but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's kind of dangerous.|sv
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't know. We live, um, well, I'm close to Salt Lake|h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and there's mountains, uh, you know, all around. But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, you know.|sd sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Really, it's, it's fairly clean, um, I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some, but, you know how quite a,|sd sd %
A|But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier?|qy
B|Yeah|ny
A|Oh .|bk
B|I think sometimes it seems to be but, But, uh, anyway, I don't know.|sv h
A|That's an interesting thought.|ba
B|I know there's a lot of plants here, when I drive down you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,|%
A|Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat, and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, like a smog problem or something like that.|sd sv
B|Oh, uh-huh. Yeah. We, we have a real fog problem. Um.|b b sd
A|Um.|b
B|The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, um, it's kind of like it, it just stays for a month quite foggy.|sd sd

B|But, uh, gee, I don't, I don't know what else.|ba h
A|I|%
B|I know cars|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's real hilly there.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that is probably something that plays a big factor. I think probably just, uh, a lot of factories, um, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, that's, that's what I see burning a lot. I'm not exactly sure what they're burning. I know, uh-huh, there are some oil companies, and I'm sure that that contributes a lot|b aa sd sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|just the burning of the|sv
A|Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?|qy
B|Oh, I don't know. I haven't, I haven't heard that.|no sd
A|Um.|b
B|I know, uh, I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything, but I know I think they, they differ from state to state.|% qy^d sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|But, um, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others. I think those, uh, what are they, the, I know, a Rabbit's one, diesel|sv % t1 % sd sd

A|That's interesting.|ba

A|What else causes air pollution? Um, Noise.|qw sv

A|Noise causes air pollution|sv
B|I've got, speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little.|% qy^d
A|Yeah, that's why I thought of it.|ny sd
B|Yeah, he is quite noisy. Yes, gee, I don't know. I know that, um, don't dumps, you know, where you dump all your trash in the, uh.|b sd % ba h % qy
A|Oh. Yeah. Landfills.|b b ^2

A|We just.|%
B|and I, I think they burn a lot there, too.|sv
A|Yeah. We just had a big, uh, thing here in Waco. They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill. And, uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.|b sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And so they,|%
B|Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that. You know, we, um|sd %

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and I'm sure that their homes are really quite  dusty|sv
A|One  one of the big concerns is they have a, there's a school right across the highway from the landfill.|sd
