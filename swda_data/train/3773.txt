B|Okay.|bk
A|How about yourself?|qo
B|Well, we, uh, left here in seventy-six. Uh, we were here for a few years, then we, uh, have come back just this summer. Right now we're looking for housing, uh, somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area. Are you familiar with that?|sd sd sd sd qy

A|right.|b
B|so we, uh, we look at the paper, we look at our, talk to our realtor and you can cut, you know, the listings, uh, in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms you know, or five.|sd sd sd

B|Oh, great.|ba
A|so I can board up their rooms, and look forward to retirement maybe.|sd
B|That empty nest syndrome is going to set in, I guess.|sv

B|Yeah, yeah. We've got five and the oldest is, uh, ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and I think they're going to be, uh, with us forever. I don't know if that's true, but it's sure, you know, we're not anywhere near looking to, uh, uh, cut down in size. We're, we're trying to find,|b b sd sd sd sv sv sd sd
A|Oh, I understand. You need very minimum four and probably five.|b bf

A|Right.|b
B|My wife and I can share a bedroom|sd
A|It's tough to find a five and six room, bedroom house, isn't it?|qy
B|Either, Oh, I don't think it's possible unless you, you know, multimillionaire, something like that.|% sv
A|Oh, I know.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|Seems like you get in that category, you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and it's that's an awful lot, you know|sv sv
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is, yeah. Uh, we're having, actually, if we find something for, uh, I'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand, we'll be doing all right, you know.|aa aa sv % sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|That's, uh, but I think the thing's out there, it's just a matter of, uh you know, looking you know finding the right place, uh,|% sv sv
A|Just, Matter of looking, right. Lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something. I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had, uh, there were seven kids in her family.|^2 aa sv sd sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|And they converted the dining room and, did this and that, but they always seemed to get along fine, you know.|sd sd
B|Oh, yeah, yeah. I think once we get into a place, it will be just fine, but you know, it's until then, it's, uh, oh, a little stressful, you know, just looking all the time and that sort of thing.|b b sd sd
A|Oh, sure. Oh, I know and it's, there's nothing harder than that. I always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore, then I would let her narrow it down to three or four, then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do.|ba aa sv sd sd sv
B|Oh, yeah. Maybe that's the case. At least she's got more opinions, you know, there's, uh, seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about. You know, openness, uh, the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and, maybe even ignore, you know.|aa aap_am sv sv
A|Yes. Why, certainly. I  understand that.|aa aa b

B|Right.|na
A|How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices?|qw
B|Uh, we were, uh, really surprised to find that they're higher here. Uh,|sd
A|No kidding.|ba
B|When we moved from Louisiana to Denver, it was astounding, you know, to find that prices were, oh, I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected. And then, uh, to come down here, we thought things would be lower, and they're not. I guess, uh, really, prices for housing are just,|sd sd sd sv
