B|And, uh, my grandmother, his, his wife uh, we also put her in a rest home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and, uh, had a physical, had a good physical therapist at that place and  they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself|sd sd sd
A|Ah.|b
B|and so  she was able to come back home|sd

A|Oh.|b
B|but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|And they got her going again.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I guess as far as looking, do things with them and treat them, treat like they're ,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she's just wondering well  what's going to happen to me|sd
B|When she can't take care of herself.|^2

B|Uh-huh. Now|b %

B|Uh-huh. Does she have a, is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to|b qy qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|or she can go down to the cafeteria?|qrr
A|Yeah, she can|ny sd
B|Uh-huh. In fact, I ,|b %
A|because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat, so I'm assuming it's something like that too.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So.|%
B|Yeah, I, I really like that concept.|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They've, they have a few of those, well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah and, you know, couples can, you know, husband and wife can, can live there too or, or whatever. I, and, and then, and yet they have their, their friendships and relationships and the, in you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that.|sd sd sd % sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|I, I think it really takes, uh, you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities.|sv
A|Uh-huh. And she lives by herself too. She seems to like it.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, my husband's grandmother is, well, she lives, she lives in a house on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but, she has her own home and she's doing really well. I'm really proud of her. She's doing really well, so we haven't had to do anything, but then again, she has a lot of support so I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Yes. Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, you know, a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like that, you know, they say putting them out to pasture and some, some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active.|b b sv sv sd
A|Yeah|b
B|They, they wanted to do things. They didn't, you know, they didn't want to go down and play bingo or, uh, you know, play with the oranges|sv sv
