B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics, and mine is a standard|sd sd

B|T I, I see. Uh-huh. Um, but yeah, I, I, uh, I don't know, I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.|bk b b h sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|Maybe it would, one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.|% sv
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Um, and it really saved us some big money once.|sd
A|It did, huh.|bh
B|Yeah, they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time|ny sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars, and I had to pay twenty five for the,|sd sd
A|Oh, that was great.|ba

B|Oh, no.|ba
A|but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.|sd
B|Bumper? Oh.|qy bk
A|It didn't actually dent the car or anything. So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,|sd sd
B|Well, that was good.|ba
A|and the store will pay for it anyway,|sd
B|Are you.|%
A|so. No big deal.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?|b qy
A|Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one|ng
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,|sd
