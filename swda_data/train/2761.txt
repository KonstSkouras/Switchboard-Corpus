B|Have a big family, I guess, that's a start.|sv sv
A|Well I guess so. Have you had any in the well how old are you?|aa qy qw
B|Twenty-five, so,|sd %
A|Okay so you  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.|bk qy^d
B|I just got married. Right, every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.|sd na sd
A|Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?|qw
B|Well, we plan on it, it's like the third weekend in August,|arp_nd sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|so it's every four years and so,|sd %
A|So they all know it.|bf
B|Yeah and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people are from down here, in Texas.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana. That's where I'm originally from.|sd sd
A|Yes.|b

A|Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they don't ever plan it as, like you do.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,  because they're rather socially active too.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|And so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there. If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.|sd sd ^q sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Therefore, they don't have many people left.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh, I haven't known many of those people, but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and that's been very nice, with, uh, I have one sister,  and three brothers|sd sd sd sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they're only three out of five of us who have children.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.|sd

A|And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they don't see each other very often, we don't really know many of them.|sd sd
B|Yeah, that's kind of bad.|b ba
A|It really is, they're fun, they're a lot of fun,|aa sd sd
