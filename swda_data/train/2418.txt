B|It really is. It, it really is. You know, that was always a, a major problem in our marriage. What I have always identified is I am basically good with money. It, I don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it. I, think that comes from never having enough.|aa aa sd sd sd sv

A|The year that they graduate, you know, before, though, you know, while they're graduating , there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away, churches and everything, and they don't even have a dozen applicants because, uh, uh, the kids are going off after the big money.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, of course, you have to have some sort of record in high school, uh, of, of achievement and everything, but sometimes it's just, uh, like our band gave money away. We're a band booster club.
