B|I mean, I I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them, but, it's so much easier to go to mom,|sd sd

B|the way that, you know, like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't.|% sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially.|sv
