A|Right, uh-huh, that's true.|aa aa aa
B|So.|%
A|I'm originally from Maine, so we like seafood, too. And that's something we don't get here, and we're in the mountains in Virginia.|sd sd sd sd

B|shrimp straight out of the bay.|sd
A|We were in Galveston last year right well, the first of this year, actually.|sd
B|Hm.|b
A|And, ate in a restaurant, and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.|sd sd

A|Oh.|b
B|You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.|sd
A|Right. We used to do that, once in a while, but we don't anymore.|b sd sd

B|Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.|sd
A|Do you, well that makes a difference.|bh sv
B|And so,|%

A|Oh, yeah, uh-huh. We eat at Shoney's.|ba b sd
B|Yeah, in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well, but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.|b sd sd
A|Oh. Uh-huh, that sounds nice.|b b ba
B|It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.|sv
A|Right, I imagine it is.|aa ba

B|Colorado Springs.|sd
A|Out of, which direction from there?|qw
