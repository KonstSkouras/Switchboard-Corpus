A|the one will take, uh, okay, let's see, I guess, uh, I can start. I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc b ^h sd sd
B|Are you really?|bh
A|Yeah. Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have. We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon. So, I'm looking for something, uh, littler  bigger,|ny sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, which are both kind of small.|b bf
A|yeah. Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Are you looking for an American car or, you open to buying foreign cars?|b qy qrr
A|Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's, you know, it, I guess the American cars had a bad reputation but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Right. Personally, I have a Japanese car right now, and I really like it a lot. Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars|b b sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now, but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.|sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car, but I would also look at American cars, but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.|sd sd sd sv
A|Yeah, I mean, even if it's just details, it seems like, uh they, you know,|b sv
B|So, if I were, Right.|sd b
A|I there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a, a design problem there.|% sd sd sd
B|Right, it is. Uh, I'm kind of, right now, the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. Uh I don't really, I don't have a family, so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in.|aa aa % % sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,|sd
A|Oh, like a Miata or something like that?|qy^d
B|Well, I like the Miata, but I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something, actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car.|^h ng sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|But, uh, something along that lines. Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay, but uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah. interesting. Yeah, I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.|b ba % sv
B|Right.|b
A|Probably,|%
B|Right.|b
A|Uh,|%
B|That's, when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage, and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money.|% sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So,|%
A|Yeah I I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and things like that.  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,|b sd
B|Right, exactly.|aa aa
A|but it, you know depends on what you, what you pay initially.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's, you know, we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles, but uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it,|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, But, uh,|%
B|Okay. Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and, and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I, I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge just from,|b sd sv sd sd sd sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car.|sv
A|That's interesting. But, yeah, it, it's hard to beat some of the, uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction, but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it|ba % % sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,|sd
B|Which is a good deal.|sv
A|Yeah, because I guess, uh, I mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know|aa % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|so all the depreciation has been taken off and, the dealer comes out okay you know,|sd sd
B|Yeah that,|b %
A|don't what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it, but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it and So, but, uh, I don't know,|sd sv h
B|Yeah, I'm sure they did.|aa sv
A|we keep looking at that mini van. It's just, you know, we can get a, like a Caravan for, twelve, five|sd % sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. But, uh, uh, it's interesting, but, uh, I don't know, if, if, uh, it seems to be,|sd sv h sv
