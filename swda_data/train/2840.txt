A|Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?|qo
B|or Well, um, I, I think that in, in, uh, recently with the, I'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system. They seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have, whether it's actually a school related thing or not and,  I.|% % sv sv %
A|I say agree with you a hundred percent there|aa
B|Yeah, and, and, well, it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything.|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If, uh, you've some kid who doesn't have, uh, who's from a broken family, the schools are supposed to fill that void. uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles.|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, some of the, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a, a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home.|b b sv sd sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and I'll say, they'll say, oh, well, our kids, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. And, and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk, and, you know, we do check with other teachers, and other teachers find the same things in  this child.|sv sv ^q ^q sv sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, you know, how do you tell your parent's, the parent, hey, wake up, and smell the coffee|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, um, it, it is a problem, and I'm not sure just, uh, how, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A, uh, and the parents being informed better, that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems, um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it.|sv
B|Yeah. Well, then, then again when you have, uh, a society where a certain percentage of the parents are, uh, doing drugs in the home uh, either unemployed and don't care about a, uh, just a have their own problems how, how do you expect the school to, um, or how do you expect the,|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.|b b b
B|you can't really expect that parent who's, quite frankly  a loser in life, as it is  to, to care about the, the situation with their child,|sv
A|That's right. Uh-huh.|aa b
B|and,|%
A|water You know what scares me too, is that we have yet to see other, the biggest effect of the crack children uh, in the school system.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|These are children that are born with low deficit, attention deficit|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, gosh, what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system. That's really scary water|qh sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But there are, I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve, and this is something that I see. Too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners, and in fact they're not. They're behavior problems.|sv sd sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|And so, they get put in, in, in our school system, in a class that's limited for skills children that have, really have to master skills.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's not their problem. Um, at the same time, I've seen, we, we have a, an international population. There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program.|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The, once they're past E S O L, they get out, they got thrown right into the total mainstream|% sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So the school systems can improve, both in standing up for splitting classes, you know, having learning learning, slow, slow children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And then, you know, the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes, you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated.|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|And then you throw in kids that are not motivated, maybe bright, but they're discipline problems. And you sometimes the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there.|sv % sv
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|You know, the gifted and talented are fast classes. There's really not that much of a problem with. But it's,|sd % %
B|Well, I, I've seen more, uh, incredibly intelligent underachievers than,  than, uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I personally I will, I would take a person who's motivated and a little, uh, less intelligent than the person who, uh, is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of, isn't motivated to do anything.|sd
A|That's, yeah. I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent perspiration.|% b sd
B|Yeah. Well, I, not to toot my own horn here or anything, but I, I was graduated from my high school, I was the valedictorian, and I know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me,|b sd sd sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all, but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than I did. And when it,|sd sd sd %
A|Yeah. I guess kids do mature at different ages  too.|b sv
B|Right.|b
A|That's, and, you know, as a teacher you, you try to make, be understanding that, you know, there are different ages, kids are, is this a, got a kid that just a question of maturity, or is he a problem child.|% sd % % sd sd

B|Right.|b
A|there's all sorts of systems where suicide, uh, predisposition. I mean, we're alerted to what the moment we see something. If we see a child that we have any reason, that's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're, if they're flashing lots of money around. We've, there are certain things to do. I mean, so the school system's asked to do so much, but you can't operate in a vacuum.|sd sd sd sd sv

A|Yeah. You know, it's, it's amazing, but uh, you get all sorts, you get all, all sorts of things, uh, in the schools, uh, uh, and it's, and you know, as a teacher you're alert, you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy. You're alert to the kid who suddenly has a, um, behavioral change, and you refer them to the nurse.|b sv sv % sd sd sd
