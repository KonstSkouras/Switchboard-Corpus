B|So, what do you think about it?|qo
A|Well, I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, well, if there is a problem, what should we do about it?|sd
B|Right Yeah, I guess that's so.|b b sd
A|Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America?|qy
B|Um, uh, I think there's some problems, but they're not really big ones. I think that, um, in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be. That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America. It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that.|na sv sv sv sv
A|Okay. That's interesting. I was, I was wondering what your response would be. I'm a first generation American.|bk ba sd sd
B|Okay.|b
A|So I'm, from immigrant parents Or an immigrant mother anyway.|sd
B|Uh, where did you come from? Okay. Okay, so where did your parents come from?|qw b b qw
A|Uh, Poland.|sd
B|Okay. And,|bk %
A|And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it's interesting that, you know, with the topic I think I agree with you.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|There needs to be more of an open policy.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor, you know, for the railroad, Transatlantic Railroad and, our Irish came and, you know, built the towns and, did labor.|sd sd
B|Yep. Uh-huh.|aa b
A|But what do you think, are you from Texas or,|qw qy %
B|I'm from Pennsylvania.|ng
A|Pennsylvania. Okay.|bk bk
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, that will be interesting.|ba
B|Right, and, uh, a lot of,|b %
A|Because we have just, had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, I'm from Texas and have become citizens now.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|What do you think about that?|qo
B|Um, I think that's all right. I, um, at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing. Do you have an opinion about it?|sv % sv qy
A|Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to?|sd
B|No, okay.|nn %
A|Because Texan philosophy is a little different.|sv
B|Right. Well, a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China. And, um, you know he, um, got a green card is, and is in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always nice to the Chinese government, and all that,|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he was always on pretty good terms with them.|sd
A|Yeah, well we,|b %
B|But, um, their, my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing. And it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem. It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here.|% sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, well, then you have first in the experience on immigration.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, that is interesting.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah. Well, I wonder, you know, even with those that were involved with Tienamen's Square.|b sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, did we really protect them?|qh
B|Yeah, that's, and I think that's pretty crazy, because I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back,|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can.|sv sv
A|That is true. That is true. Well, what do you think about,|aa aa qo
B|Yeah.|b
A|we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population that has been brought in.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|What do you think about that?|qo
B|Um,|^h
A|And these are not the brightest.|sd
B|See, these are refujees, you mean?|qy
A|I mean we we're talking boat people.|arp_nd
B|Okay. Right, okay.|bk bk bk
A|We have a lot of boat people in Texas.|sd
B|Right. Well, um, I don't have any problem with that. Um,|b sd
A|You're a true liberal heart-to-heart. Good for you.|sv ba
B|Yeah, I guess so|aa aa
A|I was ready for a fight on this one|sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|No, I agree because,|nn %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, interesting, my, when my daughter was in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and with his limited English they found out, you know, that, she was in student council, and they found out that he was a medical doctor,|sd sd
