B|So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?|qw
A|Well, actually, I love the car I have. I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible. And  I love it.|sd sd sd
B|Ah.|b
A|And I would get another one in a minute. Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that. And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car. And I'd love an expensive one but I probably,  can never afford it so|sd sd sd sd sv %
B|Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles. Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh, the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, I'm a nurse here and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.|b b sd sd
B|A, a three twenty-eight G T S?|qy
A|And I couldn't tell you but it's just beautiful. And I go out and I love to touch it but I can't even do that because of the alarm.|no sv sd sd
B|You just go hunting?|qh
A|So, I just look at it a lot|sd
B|Go out and lust after it.|bf
A|Really Exactly. But it sure is a pretty thing|aa aa sv
B|So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?|qy
A|No. I'm working on it No, I really haven't, no, huh-uh I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before. It was brand new, white, it was like a big marshmallow. When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you.|nn sd nn sd nn nn sd sd sv sd
B|uh.|b
A|I mean they came in and up and out and I mean, they did whatever and, and we went for a test drive in that and I was able to open that up pretty good and that was really fun. And I wanted it, but I had a choice of that or my house and I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house so.|sd sd sd sd sv sd sd sd %
B|Yeah, there, there's something about having a place to live, I don't know.|b sv h
A|Yeah, you know, it's just necessary. And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical.|aa sv sv
B|Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.|sv
A|Yeah, right So,|b b %
B|I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars.|sv
A|They are, they're pretty aren't they lately|qy
B|Yeah. And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive.|ny sv
A|They really are. Really.|sv b
B|It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something.|sv
A|Oh, no No, no. See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now and they go isn't that a nice van and I go, um. Not really, you know. How about  a Greyhound bus|aa aa aa sd sd sd ^q ^q
B|Nice. Yeah. Nice isn't the word I'd choose. Maybe practical.|sd aa sd sd
A|Yeah. I mean that, you know.|b %
B|Isn't that a practical van.|qy
A|There's some that are prettier than others and yeah, the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know. It's not like, like driving a little sports car.|sv % % sv sv sv
B|Yeah. It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive.|b sv
A|Yeah. I don't think that happens so, but I, I love mine, so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii and I just went home and I walked in and I picked it out and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to, and I never did. I just went back and signed the papers and I knew nothing about my car when I got it. Nothing. I didn't know how anything worked.|aa sv sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Well, so it was a completely new experience for you. And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.|bf sv
A|Yeah. And I've had it, it's almost three years actually. And I've, I still love it. I put the top down everywhere I go. I timed it when I first got it and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds.|b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|So.|%
B|And, and you couldn't get, how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.|% qw
A|Twenty seconds, yeah. That's all it takes. I mean, it's just a button, that's it. You  release it right at the top,|sd ny sd sd sd
B|Yeah, so|b %
A|so you don't have to  get out or anything.|sd
B|So you won't get, Yeah and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.|bf b sv
A|Well I did, actually. Last week going to the airport, I just hit a downpour and I was on a highway going like eighty. So I really did. I mean I was soaking wet. I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over|ar sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Whoops.|ba
A|But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but it was kind of funny. I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it but,|sv sv %
B|Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week and the weather was pretty nice too. So,|sd sd %
A|Oh and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything, yeah, yeah.|b qy ny ny
B|With the Bluebonnets out, yeah. It really was. Yeah I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.|^2 aa sv % sd
A|is Yeah. A lot of people say that and it's pretty far from where I live|b sd sd
