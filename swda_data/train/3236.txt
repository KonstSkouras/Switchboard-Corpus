A|Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel, and then I'll respond.|ad sd
B|All right. Well, I'm, uh, I'm very guilty of, of not doing my part with recycling, I'm afraid. We, um, recently moved here from North Carolina, and they had curbside recycling, and it was very easy to, you know, to put everything out there, but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now|aa sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to, to take things where take things where they belong.|sd
A|Well, how long have you been here?|qw
B|Well, we've been here since January, so we, we still feel very new,|sd sd
A|Well,|%
B|but, uh it's working up to a year now,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people.|sv
A|Yeah, I think that's a good excuse. You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things.|b sv sv
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|We've been here probably two and a half years, and, and we didn't recycle at all before we came|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I think we're doing well. We, we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, where do you take those things?|b qw
A|Well, the, um, glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart. They have, um, in behind Walmart they have bins|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we usually save up our cans and, and change them in for money.|sd
B|Well, where do you do that, because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um,|qw sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I didn't know where to take them.|sd
A|Um, there's a place on Parker Road, um, it's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart. I think there's a, a service station there. There's usually a semi truck that has a, a person there that will weigh them and, Now they aren't worth much right now,|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Oh.|bk
A|but it's better than nothing|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so|%
B|Better than nothing, right.|b^m aa
A|and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now, and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October.|sd sd
B|Yeah, I, it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, you know it's coming in a couple of months,|b % sd
A|Yeah, and, I think it's been delayed.|b sd
B|but|%
A|I think it was originally scheduled for February, but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with from what I've read in, you know, the mail that we get|sd sd
B|Oh. Right.|b b
A|and I can't wait for that, that will be easy. I get tired of newspaper littering the garage|sd sv sd
B|Yeah, it gets to be a bit much to haul it off, but.|b sv %
A|I feel guilty we don't recycle our, our milk containers because they seem like a big waste.|sv
B|Well, they, yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|yeah.|b
A|yeah, they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can|b sd
B|Right.|b
A|so, I'll be glad when the bins do come, and I think that's when I'll, I'll start doing the plastic, too.|sd sd
B|Yeah, it was real easy with the bins, it really was, it was just no effort at all, um, no more trouble than taking out the garbage, so, um,|b sd sd sd %
A|Yeah. I've gotten used to washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and things like that,|b sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's not that big of a deal, and it's nicer to just throw them out, but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah. Well, how much do you earn on the cans, I, I didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for,|b qw sd
A|Oh, when we first were, were here, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.|sd
B|Yeah. So it's gone down.|b bf
A|Yeah|aa
B|Yeah,|b^m
A|which is understandable, I think, more people are are recycling.|sv sv
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|That's something we, we don't really make any effort to, and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, you know, the, the cans|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that was kind of fun, but we haven't done that for a long time|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
B|Well, that sounds like a pretty good project.|ba
A|Well, the boys think it's fun, plus you get your exercise and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so|sd sd %
B|Oh.|b
A|but.|%
B|Well, I'll have to keep myself and, and get on it. My neighbor across the street, um, is so careful about recycling, and so I keep telling myself, I'll, I'll get it organized, but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.|sd sd sd sv
A|Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on, so|sd sv %
B|Right, right, I won't have any excuse then, that's for sure.|aa aa sv sv
A|All right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, Trying|sv
B|Thinking about it, anyway|^2
A|that's all you can do|sv
B|Yeah, but, Well, um, have you,|b %
A|so.|%
B|do they time this thing for us, or do we,|qy qrr
A|Um, yeah, you can do it as long as you want. They, you know, if it's been long enough, five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording|ny sd % sd
B|You can't chat all day, huh|qy
A|So we can say good-bye now.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|It was good talking to you, and maybe we'll get on line again.|fc fc
