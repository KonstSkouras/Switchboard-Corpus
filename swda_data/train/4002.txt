B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, of course, we look into the prices.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time. Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda.|sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|But, I don't know what we're going to buy. I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car, but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty|sd sv sd
A|Well|b

B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Because, uh, it, it it was great fun. And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand, we, uh, we decided that, uh, we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile and it, and it was just too big, so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.|sv sd sd sd sd sd sd
