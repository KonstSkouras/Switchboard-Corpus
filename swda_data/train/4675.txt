B|All rightie.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay. Do you have a budget that you go on?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
B|Yeah. I sure do. Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.|ny sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it tends to work out pretty well that way. I can anticipate, you know, a little better. I usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount.|sv sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh|b b b
B|So that works okay for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be.|b sd
B|Right.|b
A|Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh, same here.|b sd
A|Uh, very seldom are they any different. And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And then we put our receipts in there, you know, and usually that's enough.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them.|sd
B|Right. Luckily I don't either. I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off|b sd sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah, right. In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day|b b b sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Sometimes it can be. I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.|na sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing so.|sd %
A|Yeah, uh, I'm not working right now. I worked for P I E and then, uh, they went bankrupt so I just went ahead and took my early pension.|b sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh.|b b

B|My roommate only gets paid once a month and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking|sd sd
A|Yeah. So,|b %
B|so.|%
A|Yeah. So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month.|b sd
B|Right. I, for, for years got paid once a month and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were, for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|but I would pay all of them at one sitting and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it.|sd sd
A|Yeah, right.|b b
B|And, and it worked okay for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't know.|h
A|And,|%
B|Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is and so,|sv %
A|Oh, yeah. Right now it's terrible isn't it?|b qy
B|It's, yeah, it's really bad.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, it's going pretty well and I've got a real good plan mapped out here, so.|sd sd %

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along and that puts you behind too, you know. So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club.|sd sv sd
B|Oh that's, Yeah.|% b
A|So I figure, you know, that's going to help some.|sv
B|That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time. That'll, yeah,|bf % %
A|Yeah, right, you know.|aa aa
B|That'll be good, yeah most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas so.|ba % sv %

B|Yeah, I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas I didn't get in debt, so.|b sd sd %
A|Oh, that's good. I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can|ba sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh. It's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer|b sv fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I know. I even bought myself a Surgery , you know, and I just love it. I haven't learned everything to do on it yet but I figure that will help me save you know.|aa sd sd sd sv
B|Yeah. My, uh, roommate does sew some and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again. My mother always sewed. She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested|b sd sd sv sd sd

A|Yeah, and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales.|b sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|So, which I've been doing.|sd
B|Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money.|ba
