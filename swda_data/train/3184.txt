We're out of the cities quite a ways, so it's kind of more of a country setting and, uh, it's just a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home. It's, it's nothing, you know, elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or, you know. It's, it's just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story type home.|b sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and I think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are. Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's, where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is, so it's, uh, pretty much that, uh, type of, uh, home|sd sd % sd sd
