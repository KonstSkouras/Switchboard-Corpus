A|Uh-huh. What kind of things have you read?|b qw

B|Oh.|bk
A|and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically, so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems. Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse, so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway, and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible, as a teen.|sv sv sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Someone just recently said something really neat about that. Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends, and, uh, it was of the people from there that said that. His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent, and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.

A|Uh.|b
B|So, I've um,|%
