A|Okay, um, I don't know about you but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next It's pretty bad, but it's true, you know, in they tend to try to be, you know, real lax and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know. We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want. And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd sv sv sd sd sd sd sd
B|Well, I'm kind of that way too. I work in the legal department and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day, it always seems like I'm doing that and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around, so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down. But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up. Yeah, and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.|sd sv sv sd sd % sd
A|Yeah, you know, we're kind of that way too. I try to, I'm the same way you are, I kind of try to judge from day to day. I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and, and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up|b sd sd sv sd sd sd sd

A|and if I know they're not, you know, I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,|sd sd

A|and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.|sv
B|That's right, that's right.|aa aa
A|It is and so,|sv %
B|As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes. We had them in the warehouse,|sd sd sd
A|Uh.|%
B|and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned, and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer, it's unair-conditioned, it was dusty and dirty, uh, there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it. And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to, we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we wore shorts. We didn't know that was a big no, no.|sd sd
A|Oh no.|ba
B|And the supervisor from another area came up to us and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there, and he, he knew who worked there, he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there. And he came up to us and he just said, who's your supervisor. Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor, and it went up all the way to the head of facilities, complaining that we were wearing shorts.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh no in|ba
B|He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that. That could have alleviated a big problem. We ended up getting called out on it.|sd sv sd
A|Oh, how awful. It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.|ba sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't care, you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts. That's all they were. I don't care what else you call them, you know, if they're below the knee, okay, maybe you can call them split skirts. If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know. And these weren't even really full ones. I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know, and these weren't even those. These were like pretty short, black, and they were very dressy, the were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very, very nice.|sd sd sd sv sd sd sv sv sv sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|But, you don't wear shorts to work. You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation and nobody says anything to them. It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.|sv sv sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|You know, if they just, you know, the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no, this is wear we're going to draw the line. This is shorts, you know.|% sv ^q ^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,|sd
B|Um.|%
A|so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too. It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know, but.|sv ^q %
B|Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they have said no|sd
A|Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.|b sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean I've never seen them do it without hose, I mean they always have hose on, but still, it's, they're shorts, I don't care what you say, they're shorts. Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.|sd sd sd sd sd sv
B|I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code, I had a friend,|sd sd
A|Oh do they really?|qy
B|Oh definitely. I had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out. For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes.|na sd sd sd
A|Oh, my God.|ba
B|Oh, it is definitely lined out. Women are not allowed to wear slacks, you wear coordinated suits.|sd sd sd
A|I I couldn't afford to work there.|sd
B|And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel, oh it is spelled out.|sd sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it told about the dress code and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.|sd sd
A|T I says no shorts and no halters I know, that's it.|sd sd
B|Yeah, and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,|b sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.|sd
A|I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in. I mean, I see, I, I am more, I don't know about anybody else, and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts, but I am more productive when I'm in pants. I, I am. I work faster, I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know, I, and it's weird but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.|sv % sd sd sd sv sv sv sv % sv sv
B|Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel. And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything. We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know, you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.|sd ^q ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid. And she And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.|^q sd
A|You can't do that in a skirt poor soul. Oh yuck.|bf ba
B|She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that's terrible, that's terrible gosh. Well I don't know, I just figure, you know, yeah, sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants, and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know. But I'll go in in pants. I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either. And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on, but, you know, I don't know if they do or not. You know, I see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans, so, you know.|b ba ba ba h sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd %
B|Some of our people in the legal department, we have, um, assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because, there's one that always wears a suit. A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.|sd sd sv sd sd
A|Really, wow.|ba
B|And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt. So that's just,|sd sd %
A|Isn't that funny.|bh
B|With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on so. We've, we've kind of had a variety there|sd sd
A|That's great.|ba
B|but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with, or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.|sv sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|If they're just going to be meeting with T I like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual.|sd sd
A|That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It really is, because your making, you know, if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know, or it would me, you know.|sv sv h
