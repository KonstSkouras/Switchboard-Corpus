B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Do you,|qy
A|So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot. Do you work outside?|sd qy

A|Oh.|b
B|and I work with him a couple days a week|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|So that, that makes it pretty nice. It's kind of weird because before I used to work, you know, full time|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and, uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about.|sd
A|Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Right, and so it's, uh, some of my suits I haven't put on for quite a while.|b % sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b

A|Well, my, my dress up, I live out in the country also so what I wear depends on the weather.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Sure.|b b
A|Uh, so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes which I try to wear something easy to take off, you know and put on.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|And I don't too often take off my coat even, we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather.|sd
B|Yeah, yeah. Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year. Not really? Oh, is that right?|b b sv qy bh
A|Yeah, and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather.|ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh. Course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here so I don't know.|b sd h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But for now, But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, uh, cold weather. And that type of thing.|sd
B|So you all are waiting for that Uh-huh. Yeah.|sv b b
A|Now, my daughter works all the time, so she dresses. I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job where you work.|sd sd sv
B|Right. Right. Yeah. Well, down here it's sunny most of the time. And, uh, usually warm.|b b b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month, but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had so far.|sd sd
A|Um, uh-huh.|b
B|So, I mean people are still wearing shorts and and, uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so you start you know, breaking out a coat at that time,|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right, yeah.|b b b b b
B|but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months|sd
A|Did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts.|qy qrr
B|No. No, never wore slacks.|nn nn sd
A|No slacks.|b^m
B|It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was one of those understood things that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even if it's all,|b b b qy^d
B|Not, No, not, not with what I did. Uh,|nn nn sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Most people didn't.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sometimes, like the secretaries might|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much. And I really, you know, there's some nice pantsuits out and and I wouldn't have minded, you know, wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold.|sd % sv sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b b b
B|But, uh,|%
A|I know my daughter mostly, I don't think she ever wears slacks to work.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh,|sd
B|You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional. I guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses.|sv sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Look more like a woman, huh|b b sv
B|Yeah That's right|aa aa
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|And it's the men that make the rules|sv
A|Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then that way.|sv
B|But, no, we usually, you know, skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc % sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|No, no one can see me unless I'm, you know,|sd
A|Yeah. But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I, I believe,|b sv
B|Yeah. Yeah. But, I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him|b b sd
A|Oh, you don't think you will, huh Well, you'll be excused because considering everything|qy sd
B|Yeah, I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. But I, I look at homemaking as a job also. Uh, being a homemaker|b b sd
B|Right.|b
A|and I, I think sometimes we lose sight of that. Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
