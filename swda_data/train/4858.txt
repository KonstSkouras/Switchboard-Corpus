B|You know, we, uh, those people that I know, I work with several that were over there, and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday, I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd, come back and you know. But that they weren't really allowed to do anything.

A|Yeah, it's funny. Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin. And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh, I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.|b sv sd sd sv sv

B|Yeah.|b
A|And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it. Otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. That, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line Uh, I guess you can, I guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end. But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order to, uh, call the bully out and beat him. And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward. And, uh  we were wrong But I, uh, you know, the, like I said, the more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. But the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where, and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean.|sv sd sv sd sd sd % sd sd sd
