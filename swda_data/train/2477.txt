A|Okay, so which, uh, what basketball teams are you interested in?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qw
B|Well, I guess I'm a big Laker, L A Laker fan, when it comes to pros.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the college ranks, um, I guess I really, of course I try to follow my alma mater, that's, uh, B Y U, in Utah.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|But they don't have much of a team usually.|sv
A|No, they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.|aa sv
B|Yeah, yeah. You see them in football on T V once in awhile.|aa aa sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You never see them on a, on nationally basketball.|sd
A|You know, that's true. I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball.|aa sd
B|They, uh, last year they had a really good team, the year that Danny Aines was there.|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That was about five, six years ago by now.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|So, they made it to the sweet sixteen, once or twice, in their history,|sd
A|Um. That's not too bad.|% sv
B|and that's, and they usually lose in the first round.|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, I'm, uh, originally from the Saint Louis area, so the only basketball team, pro anyway, in that part of the country is Chicago. So, I, I do pull for Chicago.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a, a Chicago fan, I guess, because they're doing pretty good.|sv
B|Is it the Bulls you're talking about?|qy
A|Yeah, yeah.|ny ny
B|Yeah, the pro,|b bf
A|Um, as far as college teams, uh, I know it's really easy to say, but I've been pulling for, uh, Duke for about four years now so, uh, so, I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although, I've, I've really, you know,|sd sd sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, but they're on, uh, probation this year so you can't do much about that.|sd sv
B|No, no.|aa aa
A|But, uh,|%
B|So, did you watch the, uh, final four this year?|qy
A|Oh, yeah. I watched every, uh, I watched all three games of that.|ny sd
B|Every game?|^2
A|And, uh, I was very pleased with all three games, because Kansas, uh, you know, I was pulling for Kansas on the other side, so it was real nice to have the, the teams that were there.|sd sd sd
B|Right, right.|b b
A|Of course, I wasn't really, I mean, I, I, U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a, uh, uh, oh, I don't know, a macho team, you know, they just didn't seem, they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and, and maybe they were, but, um, I was real happy to see them get knocked off. So,|sd % sd sv sv sd %
B|Yeah. I, I watched that game.|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it was a good game.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It was a very close game, and hard fought game. And it just, I don't know, it looked like U N L V may have had more, uh, talent,|sd % h sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, as far as playing together as a team that day, it didn't, Duke seemed to have them off balance.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that, uh, they didn't, couldn't, aren't they more of a running gun team ?|sv qy
A|U N L V, yeah, they, they play the pro style, is, what I've always called it.|b^m ny sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Yeah, fast breaks and things and,|aa sd
A|yeah, the fast breaks and, and,|aa b^m
B|They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed and,|sv %
A|Right. And, uh, U N L V wasn't used to that. Of course, I've, I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time, see I don't know if they were necessarily behind, but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are.|aa sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, and, you know, that meant that they had to play a second half and they, they've not had to do that all year and, uh,|sd sd %
B|Right, right. They didn't have, they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year and that, and that, so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that, right in, when it, when it counts so much.|aa aa sd sv
A|That's right. I mean Duke's schedule was, was so much harder than U N L V's that it, uh, it just made them a much tougher team overall,|aa sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, that had to help them a lot.|sv
B|I think, I think that, that probably was the difference in that game.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know.|sv
A|So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, uh,  will win|qy
B|Well,|%
A|or,|%
B|I don't know. Probably not.|no nn
A|I mean, Portland's pretty good. Um,|sv
B|Since Kareem's retired,  they haven't had a center.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, they've got Perkins,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I don't think he's really been a super star for them.|sv
A|No. Well, he's, uh, I don't, I, he, he to me is not a center, he's more of a, a real tall forward|aa % % % sv sv
B|Yeah. Right, right.|b aa aa
A|Uh,|%
B|So,|%
A|I think Magic does a,|sv
B|They'll make it, you know, it, it's going to be a war between, uh, between Chicago and, uh, and, uh, uh, Boston Celtics.|sv sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|That's going to be a war.|sv
A|That sure is. It,|aa %
B|It's going to be a great series.|sv
A|I think that's going to be one of those that's, uh, that's won by the home team, you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think.|sv
B|One of those two will probably be, um, in there, um, let me see, where does Detroit fit in?|sv ^h qw
A|Detroit's in that same, uh, that, that same, uh, division.|sd
B|Uh-huh. So, I don't know, those three, uh, Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year.|b h sd sv
A|No, but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week.|aa sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, that might help them.|sv
B|Yeah. They have the, they have the play-off experience, but,|aa sd %
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so does Detroit, I mean, so does Chicago. So all three of them do, with Larry Bird back, uh,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's,  starting to click on all cylinders.|sv
A|That's true. Uh-huh.|aa b
B|They say he's starting to do, starting to play,|sd
A|He's, yeah but he's been, yeah, but he's been kind of up and down all year.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|uh, one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he'll, you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn.|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, I don't know,|h
B|Right.|b
A|I'm, I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year.|sd
B|Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Well that's when,   you do it.|b sv
B|He's,   starting to be more consistent, you know, right at the right time of the year.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, any dark horses I, uh, you know,|sd
A|Well, the dark horses,|b^m
B|San Antonio,  San Antonio is the dark horse that could, could really flip in there, I think.|sv
A|Yeah that's, Yeah. Well, anybody who has David Robinson, has got to have a chance anyway.|b % aa sv
B|Yeah. He's got to be pretty much, you know, I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player, you know, when he,|b sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|against any team he would dominate, but Robinson's getting up there where , every game, he's just,|sd sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, you know,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's, when he's driving hard to the hoop.|sv
A|Huh.|%
B|He's, uh, he's, too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him.|% sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble.|sv
A|Yeah. Well then, he's gone now so,  they don't have to worry about that.|aa sd sv
B|Yeah, for awhile anyway.|aa sv
A|Well, I thought he was gone period. I, I didn't read the story, but I, I, read that, uh,|sd sd sd
B|I heard he was suspended.  Because of his,|sd
A|Well, that might have been what it was, but I, I guess the headlines said something about him, you know, that the Mavericks released him or something, I, maybe I misunderstood what they meant.|sd sd sd
B|Um. If they did, they'd still have to pay his contract|sd
A|Well, yeah|b
B|They may have done it.|sd
A|you never know.|sv
B|It was a lot of money. He was making like,|sd sd
A|Yeah but,|b %
B|I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month. That's what he was being paid, you know, he wasn't even playing.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, boy, what a good job he had|sv
A|That's what I think.|aa
B|He ruined his sweet position|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah. I'm looking forward to the, the pro play-off, uh,|b sd
A|Yeah. It's coming up, isn't it.|b qy
B|L A, yeah, San Antonio, who's the other one that's doing so well this year, is that Portland?|sd ny sd qw qy
A|Portland. Yeah, Portland.|na ny na
B|Portland. I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all, but all I can do is hear about, boy they have the seeing eye.|b^m sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do they have Walter Davis and,|qw sd
A|They've got two, the two Johnson brothers or they're not brothers, but I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something, I forget how that works. But, um, like I said they're doing extremely good right now.|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Um.|%
A|Phoenix isn't doing too bad. So, It, it ought to be a real interesting play-off.|sv sv
B|Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.|aa aa b b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't think there's any clear pick, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird, and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They are two guys that seem to find a way when they,|sv
A|When it's on the line.|^2
B|When it's on the line, they seem to find a way. You know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, so, those are what makes a champion I guess.|sv
A|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, it's been nice talking to you.|fc
