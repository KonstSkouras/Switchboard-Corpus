B|Do you like to cook?|qy
A|I love it.|sd

A|Uh,|%
B|It, it's kind of hard to find time sometimes but,|sd %
A|Do you work?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|And have a family?|qy^d
B|Uh, I don't have a family, but I, I usually work about fifty hours a week and, by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal.|ng sd sd
A|Oh! I expect so. Uh, well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.|ba ba sd
B|That's, that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,|sd
A|Oh|b
B|so Where did you get your recipe for it?|qw
A|Um, I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have.|sd
B|Oh, okay. Well mine actually came from the, um, Texas Instruments Cafeteria.|bk sd
A|Oh.|b
B|They, they,|%
A|They have a T I plant in Texas, in Kingsport?|qy^d
B|Yeah, we have, it's in Johnson City.|ny % sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes, you know, like once a month, they'll put out a recipe of the month.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, great.|b ba
B|And they, they put this one out and I tried it and it was really good.|sd sd sd
A|What is, uh, is a marsala wine a sweeter wine?|qy
B|Yeah, a little bit sweeter.|ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it, uh, it's a, it's a red wine.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|And, uh, I'm trying to think what else. I, I roll it in bread crumbs and, uh, Parmesan cheese,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, then I rub it with a little bit, I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil, and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes, so that it gets just enough flavor.|sd
A|Huh. Oh. Oh, so it kind of browns and then you put wine over it.|b b sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh. That sounds real good.|b ba
B|And, it's really easy too so,|sd %
A|Yeah.|b
B|What do you use ?|qw
A|What do you serve with it?|qw
B|Huh?|br
A|What do you serve with it?|qw
B|I like to serve, um, a wild rice with it.|sd
A|Uh-huh. That's what I do too|b sd
B|This is really neat. And, I, we're big broccoli fans.|ba % sd
A|Uh-huh that's what I've got. I've got steamed broccoli down on mine|b sd sd
B|Well, I just, I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that.|sv
A|No, it's great. I've got a good dessert recipe.|aa sv sd
B|Oh, what?|qw
A|Uh, do you like angel food cake?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|I just break it up in a glass bowl,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then I mix up, uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta and some cool whip,|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|and I make a thickened blueberry sauce and I layer it with, uh, angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping.|sd sd
B|What time should we be there? That sounds wonderful|bh ba
A|It is, it's great.|sv
B|I love desserts, but since there's only two of us, it's really,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that, we'd like too much and eat too much|sd
A|Right. I know, I know what you mean. We don't eat desserts much any more.|b sd sd
B|But I, I guess one that, that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile, and it's, it's called a fruit pizza.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you take a, uh, sugar cookie, uh, recipe, and, and spread it out on a pizza pan.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So you make it like a pizza crust, and then you, you bake that and then you, um, take things like kiwi, and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you mix that with, um, excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice and I can't remember what else is in it and you make kind of a glaze,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then you layer your fresh fruit on that.|sd
A|Oh, and pour that over it?|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|That sounds great.|ba
B|It is really good, and it, it's real light|sv sd
A|It would be pretty.|ba
B|and it, depending on the fruit you use it's, you know, it's real colorful.|% sd
A|Right. Yeah.|b b
B|Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries.|sd
A|Right. That would be pretty.|b sv
B|So, but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream|sd
A|We've been fixing something lately that, well we've been cooking a lot of, turkey breasts. Because it's low fat.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just so much better for you.|b b sv
A|And I've been making a hot sandwich. I toast a piece of whole wheat bread, and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it, and pop it in the microwave.|sd
B|Oh! That sounds great.|b ba
A|It is delicious. I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody.|sv sd
B|No, and that's that's something that just, you know, it doesn't take a long time to fix,|aa sd
A|No.|aa
B|it's really good, and it's really good for you.|sv sv
A|Yeah, it's real quick.|b sd
B|And we eat out a lot and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out,|sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|and I wish I had something a little bit different, to just like she snaps her zap together.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Well mix up a little, uh, mayonnaise with some dijon mustard, and honey until it just,|b b % ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mix it until it just tastes good to me.|sd
B|I was going to say, do you just mix it to taste?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Okay.|bk
A|Yeah, and it's real good. And it keeps in the refrigerator.|b sd sd
B|How long, does it keep, do you, well you wouldn't have to make,|qw % qy^d
A|Oh, it keeps a long time.|sd
B|Yeah, and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even.|b sd
A|No, uh-huh, it keeps a long time.|aa aa sd
B|I'm sorry I keep coughing. I've had a bad cold.|fa sd
A|Oh. And I put a little, um, oh, yogurt in it too.|b sd
B|Plain? Plain yogurt?|qy^d qy^d
A|If I, just plain yogurt. It gives it a little tang.|% na sd
B|I'll bet that is really good.|ba
A|It makes a great sandwich.|sv
B|Man, I'm going to have to think of that. We're getting company tonight,|ba sd sd
A|Oh, are you|b
B|and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian.|sd
A|Oh, yeah, that's kind of hard.|b sv

A|They'll eat fish?|qy^d
B|Yeah.|b
A|She'll eat fish.|sd
B|And, I usually, when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, definitely go with, it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, to make up for the lack of meat.|sd
A|Right, uh-huh, that sounds good. Right. I had a recipe from that, um, INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO, that's a great salad in summertime. Do you, do you garden or not?|b b ba aa sd qy
B|No we don't, our next door neighbors do and some, a lot of times they'll give us something.|nn sd sd sd

B|Yeah. Oh! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.|b ba b b b
A|And everybody loves it and it's so easy, and it's delicious.|sd sd sd

B|You know, we don't have that much of it now. As long as we have plenty of vegetables, and lots of chicken.|sd sd
