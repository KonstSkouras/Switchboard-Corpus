A|So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city? Is it, uh,|qo %
B|Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad. Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things. Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day. Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever, so.|sd %
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|What part of California are you from?|qw
A|San Jose, California.|sd
B|Oh, really? I have a good friend there.|bh sd
A|Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs.|sd
B|Yeah .|b
A|A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole, we've only been here a couple of years. Uh, before that we lived in Colorado but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable.|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh yeah. Uh-huh.|aa aa
A|I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense, I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night.|% sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, that's|aa aa %
A|You know. And it, it's that kind of thing and, uh,|b sd %
B|That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,|sv
A|Yeah. We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort.|aa sd
B|Sure.|b
A|Do you have that where you live or,|qy %
B|Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here, I'm an intern and then I go  back down in May.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it. Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks.|sd sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation  down there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, because they were just, it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because  everybody went to work, you know,|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then the houses were left unguarded, uh, but yeah, I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it, that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood  watch.|sd % sv sv
A|Yeah. Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home.  Like on the weekends.|b sd
B|Oh, is that right?|bh
A|A high percentage of, uh, free time, I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors.|% sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So they wait while you're out, outdoors. They know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know.|sv sv sv
B|That's amazing.|ba
A|They know exactly what they're going for.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as  uh, you know, a new type of crime.|sd
B|Uh, Yeah, it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.|b aa sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Really, you know.|b
A|Unfortunately, yes.|aa
B|Yeah, unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and  where they are at particular points of the day.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, yeah. I guess,|b %
A|I mean,|%
B|I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis, I'm not real sure. Uh,|sd h
A|Yeah, it helps to know your neighbors, you know. They give you, you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars. Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?|b sv % sv sd qy
B|Pretty much.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah. I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it.|b^m sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then I left right in the middle of it. I'm not sure  where we went from there,|sd sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|but,|%
A|Yeah. Well.|b
B|Yeah, that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure.|b^m sv
A|Uh-huh. I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do. You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night|b sv sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do.|sv
B|Yeah. One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited|aa sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know. They could basically, uh, when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors  um, things like that like|sv % sd
A|Uh-huh. That's, Uh-huh.|aa % b
B|they did in Miami that time.|sd
A|But it's not, uh, if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though.|% sv
B|That's not always true.|ar
A|It isn't?|bh
B|No. There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed|nn sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Huh.|b b
B|The guy came in while he was home and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned. He didn't die, but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Really.|bh
B|Yeah. So that really, that makes you think, you know.|ny sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's like your hands are very much tied.|sv
A|Yeah. Well I think if, if you had a handgun though, in other words it wasn't premeditated, you had a handgun, it's the middle of the night, someone's|aa sv
