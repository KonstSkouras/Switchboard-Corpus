B|Who's that?|qw
A|It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and one of those was to Buffalo. And they beat the Saints. Their only time they lost.|sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Saint Louis is trying to get a team. Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team, and there's some other city. I'm wanting to say Raleigh but I'm not sure.|sd sd sd sv h
B|You know, I think you are right. I think it is Raleigh.|aa sv
A|Think so?|bh
B|I think I remember hearing that.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Because I know they've got a football team but I think it might be them.|b sd sv
B|That would be fun. I'd like to see some more teams get in.|sv sd
A|I would, definitely. I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after. And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.|aa sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.|sd sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah. It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,|ny sd
