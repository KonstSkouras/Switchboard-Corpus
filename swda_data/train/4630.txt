A|Uh, I basically, uh, listen to the news from the T V. That's probably the only time I get a chance to, uh, uh, take a look at it is the evening news and, and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise. But, uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through, uh, uh, you know, uh, through conversation or whatever but, uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening so that's about the,|sd sd sd sd sd %
B|You don't get any newspapers?|qy
A|Newspapers? No, I'm not too much in reading newspapers. Uh, not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever. We get our weekly news around the area and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, uh, news coming in that kind of stuff.|br nn sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Well, that's, that's kind of like you said then. We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever. But, uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.|sd sd sd sd sd

Well it brought kind of, uh, more of a vivid, uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things. But, uh, yeah, that's true. You know you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on and, uh, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all so.

A|Yeah, that's about the only time in the, in the summer, uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on, they'll kind of say, well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever. This is the, what is expected, but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, uh, so fast you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever|ny sv sd sd sd
