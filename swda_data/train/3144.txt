A|Oh|b
B|And course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles. It was so funny. Both of them were great.|sv sd sv sv
A|Oh, well good. I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they,|ba sd
B|Oh, they are, are we just laughed so hard. And like I said, with CITY I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know.|aa sd sv sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|Just, they just carried it off, to the tee.|sv
A|Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S  that was out a couple of years ago.|qy^d

B|Shoot, yeah.|ba aa
A|It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too. I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out.|sv sd
B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And the whole theater was hysterical and it's just, it's just goofy. I mean, it's, uh, if you have a chance to rent it, at least, or it should be out on T V, I would think,|sd sv % ad sv
B|Yeah, I think it is. I think it is.|aa sv sv
A|Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy, make your cheeks hurt laughing. Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know|sv sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with   everyone laughing.|sv
B|Oh gosh I never laughed. And people were just screaming and applauding and, you know, it was just hysterical.|ba sd sd sv
A|Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery|sd

A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|but see I don't have permanent work. I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency. And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free.|sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants, and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day. And I said, yeah, and I went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that. And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week. And so I went to my doctors last Thursday, and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well, I just can't get over this. He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things. If you want to play ball, you can go play ball. He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd ^q sd ^q sd ^q
A|Yeah|b
B|And, uh, you know, he was teasing me and he says, yeah, you'll be out there waterskiing, I can just see it now. And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks. You've only got two more weeks. I said okay fine, I, I will, I will Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know. But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.|sd sd ^q ^q sd ^q sd ^q sd

B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too. Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too, but knew that, uh, we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful. We're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing, uh  there's just not a time, enough time to do it all|sv sd % sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he said, well, realistically  You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD. Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics. He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big but the, the fire scenes and the you know  that action part is fantastic.|sd sd sd sd
