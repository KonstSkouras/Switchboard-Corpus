A|And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something, um.|oo_co_cc
B|Yes, uh-huh. sure. Right,|aa b b b
A|Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|No, nor am I.|nn sd
B|I avoid them with all|sd
A|They are a lot of work, that is for sure.|sv sd
B|Yeah, they are, I mean I do them,|aa aa sd
A|Yes.|b
B|but they are a lot of work.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I usually have them when I, there is a special event in our lives and I, I make a big deal out of it for them.|sd sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.|sd
A|Yeah. Right, yes.|b b b
B|You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust and, you know, I can make my pies from scratch,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do not need a recipe to follow. And, uh,|sd %
A|Oh, that's great. You sound like my mother who has been, well I bake pies too, but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same, the same technique, I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just,  kind of do it second nature.|ba sd sd sd sd sv
B|Yeah, you just know from heart. I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one, and I made her one.|b ^2 sd sd sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody". And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.|sd sd
A|She enjoyed it, huh|qy
B|Yes|ny
A|Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we had a, a, an auction one time at the church excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars|sd sd
B|My word, she must have a great pie recipe then.|ba sv
A|Well, I think I, I have had it once and it has been a few years ago, but I do recall that it was quite good, so, uh,|sd sd sd %
B|Wonderful.|ba
A|Yeah. So, that is her specialty, uh, I like to bake, uh, also, I do not bake so much now that my children are grown, but I do enjoy baking and I guess I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that, that was more my specialty, I suppose.|b sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|And they seem to last longer than pies around here pies would go practically, in a day's time|sd sv
B|Yeah you, That's right, yeah they are meant for the, that evening's, dessert|b % aa aa sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you know, the leftovers.|sd
A|Right|b
B|Puts about two more inches on his waistline and then he is chastising,  himself afterward|sd sd
A|And , Well, it is interesting that, yesterday, I had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.|% sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|For, um, uh, one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town and, uh, they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them that, uh, I said "well, what did you have" and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food, but, you know, she had, uh, uh, guacamole and, uh, I cannot remember all she had. But she also had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think. Have you ever made that or had it?|% sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd qy
B|No, I have not, huh-uh.|nn sd nn
A|It's, uh, it's, um, I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, uh,|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's just a wonderful dessert. It's like, uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.|sd sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to make, but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.|sd sd
B|Sure, yeah.|b b
A|But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago. And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that you get, there.|sd sd
B|Like apple pie in America, right.|bf qy^d
A|Yeah, uh-huh.|ny ny
B|Uh-huh. Wow, uh-huh.|b ba b
A|It's just very customary to get flan. So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner, but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that. But|sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|flan is something you can, make ahead and have just, you know, have ready|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh. Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon, but I tell you it, I my it's one of those things where it does require some real, uh, planning and, it's, you know,|sd % % % sv %
B|Yes, uh-huh.|aa aa
A|you don't just make the dinner, you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.|sv sv
B|Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean|sd
A|Yeah. Probably a good way to do it. Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party|b aa sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, you know, until, well we have, my husband and I have been married twenty six years, and until last year I had never had another person clean my house, and, then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".|% % % sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, I had a woman come in, uh, once a month, and you know, it was not just very often, but for me it was wonderful|sd sd sd
B|Sure, yeah that is nice, you know, to have that, that's a, luxury, today.|b b sd sv
A|Well, it is, and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess.|% aa sv
B|That's right, yeah, yeah.|aa aa aa
A|So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, well, uh, I,|%
B|I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it,|sd
A|Uh-huh. I have heard about that.|b sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then you, uh, put in your liquid.|sd
A|Yeah. Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes, the crust better.|b qy
B|It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,|sd
A|Uh. Interesting.|b ba
B|and, you can really treat it rough and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.|sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah, boy, that, that's the real secret.|b b ba
B|Like, uh, it's not mine, it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and, it will still be flaky. I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, it makes me think of years ago, uh, when I was visiting my mother-in-law in, uh, Michigan, she lived very near an apple orchard and we just had, we could take as many apples as we wanted from it. you know, according to the owners, and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know, and freeze them,|% sd sd % sd sd sd
