A|, how do you feel about crime in the city? You say you're from Atlanta.|qo sd
B|Right, I, I, I actually I live in the city|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I guess it is a concern of mine, uh, you know, for my own safety.|sd
A|Uh-huh. I mean, do you, do you find crime in Atlanta really I live in Atlanta also.|b qy sd
B|Well that's right. Uh, I think it is bad in certain areas, *sv|ba
A|Uh.|%
B|however I think, the area that I live in it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused uh.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?|b qw
B|Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility, and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .|sv
A|I probably agree with that.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there. They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.|sv sv
A|Yeah, that's probably true. Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?|aa aap_am qy
B|Um, well, I've been to, I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime. Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example.|% na sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.|sv
A|Uh-huh. I don't think it's as bad as L A either.|b sv

A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|It's that obvious.|sd
A|Yeah, I don't know, I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.|b h sv
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
