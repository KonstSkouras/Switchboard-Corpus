A|And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone so let's do something else.|% sd
B|Right. You want to, uh, explore a new field or, or,|aa bf %

B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And, uh, they're cutting back, so I don't go in all that often but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things. Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars and I say, oh no and , and I go and I make it.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's how I started jewelry making. I, I love to cook.|sd sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff and I went and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.|sd sd sd sd
B|Exactly.|aa
A|And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars It took me a lot of time but  it didn't,|sd sd sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know, and then I,|sd %
B|And your time, then you're that much farther ahead|^2 sv
A|Yeah. Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons. It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.|b sd sd
B|Right. I've seen them and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in and,|b sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|That's neat.|sv
A|I went there, we have Home Depot out here. I don't know if you've heard of it. I went and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.|sd sd qy^d sd sd
B|Yes. We have one.|ny sd
A|I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath and cutting that wedge out was no joke|sd sd
B|Huh. Oh, I'm, I'm sure.|b ba
A|We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd
B|A band saw? What?|qy^d br
A|I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the teacher was one of these negative people, oh that's dangerous, we can't do that, we just can't do that. And I'm going well how about this way? I, I want to do that, that was the plan here|sd ^q ^q ^q sd ^q ^q
B|Right.|b
A|So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.|sd
B|A cradle for it. Yeah, so you can steady it and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?|^2 b bf qy
A|Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that|sd sd
B|Right, right.|b b
A|and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw. I said I'm not that steady, it's not going to happen.|sd sd ^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|So we built a cradle for it and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw, by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about|sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|So,|%
B|Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?|qy
A|Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth. You know|ng %
B|Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh, it's, uh, if you're looking at adding on you have,|sd % sd sd
