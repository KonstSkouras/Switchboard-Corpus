A|Sure. I have a Springer Spaniel, and her name is Thumper. She's about seven or eight years old. I got her for Christmas from my family, and, uh, back when we lived in Nebraska.

B|he's, yeah, he's great, and uh, he's, uh, he's really spoiled, though So, but he's really big, so, lots of times he, it, he seems to get in fights, and when he was younger I think he started them, and now, I think he barely makes it. I think he gets beat up even though he's big, because he's pretty much overweight, and comes home with a few scratches now and then,|% aa sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Well, we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town, and, uh, we thought that, we have a cat now, but we thought, Well, if we ever get another cat, you know, we'd want something kind of unique, so, we kind of looked around, and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the, uh, Maine Coon cats.|sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|I work for a university, and I went to, uh, Omaha, Nebraska to recruit students, and I had some time off in the afternoon, so I went to a, a pet shop, and I saw these little Springer Spaniels|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|and so I decided, well, you know, this would really be a nice dog to have, so, when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it, and I said, You know, this is just a, I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now|sd sd sd ^q
B|I know what you mean.|ba
A|And Christmas is coming up, hint, hint, and so, I had to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university, and one of the people, uh, that we went with, uh, they were friends of ours, and so, we got to Omaha, and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog, and so I got over there, and she said, Oh, that's too bad, the dog has already been sold. And I didn't realize it, but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog, and she was in the back room, and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high school students or college students, and, and, uh, he had the dog the whole time in his room, and, and I had no idea. And so we headed back to Carney that night, and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car, and I guess while we were inside eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car, and, uh, finally we made it back to, uh, to Carney and,|^q sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd %
