A|Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?|qy
B|Oh, this is kind of tough. I don't too often watch, you know, shows that are on, on a regular bases.|^h ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't have a lot of time and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth. I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.|sd sd sv
A|No.|b
B|But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES, every week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, ugh, it's kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things. Uh, like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch, uh, KNOTS LANDING|% sd sd
A|Oh, you will?|bh
B|Yeah, just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type of thing,|ny sd
A|Relax.|bf
B|but, uh. How about you?|qo
A|Well, I watch, um, I like news programs, like you mentioned, and sometimes I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah, I don't get that so I don't have, that choice.|b sd
A|Yeah, I, I like that. I, I watch that a couple of times a week, um, it comes on like at nine o'clock, at night|b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch regularly. I, I have seen that, um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on, Monday nights before|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's kind of cute,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, but I don't,|%
B|But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh, fellow.|sd
A|Oh, but,|b
B|I mean he's playing a military part. He's the husband of, the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Right. I know who you're talking about. I haven't, I have seen it, I think, maybe once.|b b sd sd
B|Yeah, you know, it it was on one time when I saw it and, you know, it, it's pretty cute.|b sd sv
A|I like that Well, I, um, I, we really don't watch too many programs regularly. My children like some of the morning children's shows, when they're home.|sd % sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|They, um, I just have one son who's in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's called. It's just like a SESAME STREET, show,|% sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but and they watch a couple of shows like that, but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.|sd sd
B|Yeah, no I don't,|b aa %
A|And, uh,|%
B|I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh, and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time. But, uh, they have programs on, uh, house repairs and, how to build things|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Um.|b %
B|and, um, they have a calligraphy show, and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that.|sd sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those. I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something, and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.|sd sd sd
A|That sounds like a good idea. I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V, and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,|ba sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I record some. And then, uh, we have just totally cut down, and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then, and watch and then record over it, something else.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.|sd
B|Yeah, we do some of that, In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V, than, you know, other kinds of things.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies, that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.|b sd sd
B|Yes. Yeah. Yeah, those are pretty good I, I like those old ones, much better than some of the new stuff.|b b b sv sd
A|Uh-huh. Right. And so we, we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out. Some of the video rentals can be expensive and,|b b sd sd sd %
B|Yeah. And, boy, the movie can be unbelievable.|b ^2 ^2
A|Uh-huh, right. Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something. So we, I have, and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you take the notion.|b b sd % % sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so, I have really enjoyed that but, but there are, I do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it. They have some programs that they won't miss.|sd % sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, I'm not that hung up to most things. I mean if I miss something big deal|b sd sd
A|Yes. Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,|b sv
B|Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah.|b ba b b
A|the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again. Pretty funny.|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, T V is something that we try to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say.|sd
B|Yeah. We do too. Too many other things to do and too much going on.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your, spare time.|b sd
B|Right. Right. I agree.|b aa aa
A|So it's a little bit, something that we try doing and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational but still you want them to go out and do other things. Even if they're, good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.|sd sd sd
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|Anyway. Well,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay. Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?|b qy
A|Yeah, That was pretty good I, I like that and, um, I guess it's time to go.|ny sv sd ad
B|Okay. I enjoyed talking to you.|aa fc
A|Yes. Nice to have spoken with you, too.|fc fc
