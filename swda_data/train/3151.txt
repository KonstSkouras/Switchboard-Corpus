B|Well, how do you feel about spot spot testing for drugs?|qo
A|Well, basically I think it would be a good idea myself. I, uh, I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, you know, to be afraid of it.|arp_nd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I do think that there has to be some controls, uh, like, I don't think one test positive should, uh, be, uh, the end of it, you know.|sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|I, I think they should test more than once.|sv
B|Yeah, it's, it's  it's refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine.|aa sv
A|It,|%
B|I mean, all these people that are against it that may, you know, they may not even be on drugs. They, they call it an invasion of privacy.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And I don't see that. To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for|sv sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|aa aa
B|But,|%
A|There's so many jobs that, uh, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and, you know, and it's, uh|sv %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?|qh
B|Right.|b
A|You know, and I just, um, I, I think  there definitely needs to be some control to it.|sv
B|Right .|b
A|I guess it is possible to have a false positive report.|sv
B|Yes. No, I, I, I agree that, you know, you, there needs to be a, a well thought out, sane approach to, how to administer that program.|aa ar sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Just because you, you, something can get mixed in the mail, or uh, the chemicals could react incorrectly than, than what you would expect them to.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, yeah, you, you know|% %
A|Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, those things do happen.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined  uh, wrongly.|sd
B|Right, and, you know, I've the, the, the company that I work for, uh, has just recently, well, you know, within the last couple of years, instituted for all new hired employees, they submit to a urine test.|aa % sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And, they, they say that there's been, you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, you know, it's been in progress|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I, I fully agree with it and there's, you know, there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy, and I, I agree with you.|sd sd aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've, you've probably got something you're trying to hide|sv
A|Yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do  that, uh, doesn't require the testing.|aa sv
B|Yeah. Right.|b b
A|Uh, to me, it's, to me it's not an invasion or privacy. I think it's people have a right to know if, if, uh, their, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, uh, Yeah.|sv sv
B|Or, the quality of their product.|^2
A|Their work, the work they're doing for their company. Uh, those things are all affected. If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first. It doesn't seem to, uh, bother the quality of work|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but eventually it does.|sv
B|Right, because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|aa aa b
B|Um.|b
A|Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem. I, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know, and it's destroying a lot of   people's lives|sd sv sd sv
B|and then   and one of the few that they don't have a cure for|sd
A|Yeah, and it's, you know, it's, it's destroying people's lives and I, I think that person, plus anybody in danger should, should know about it and be aware of it.|aa sv sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I don't know. It's, it's kind of hard to I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, uh, an invasion of privacy. Of course, that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today, I guess. So, I kind of get off on a tangent here.|h sv sv sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|Uh, do you work for, uh, Texas Instruments?|qy
B|Yes, I do.|ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm, I'm down in the, the central, but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas, but I'm in a, we live in a town, uh, near a town called Temple. Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway.|sd qw^d sd

A|Uh, I can't think of anything else, uh.|sd
B|Yeah, I, I guess being in agreement  kind of tends to limit the conversation  you know|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, I can understand I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them, I can see them objecting. You know? there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with .|b b ba sv sv
B|One of the things I found interesting, it, it's funny that you mentioned that, T I is pretty much a worldwide company|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|Yeah, they don't have to submit to drug testing like, like they do here in the States and some places abroad.|b sd
A|Oh, I'll be darn.|ba
B|Yeah, I thought that was kind of interesting too.|b sd
A|Yeah, yeah, the different cultures and that  too, uh|b b sd
B|Yeah. I mean, uh, uh, from a quality standpoint, that's not, I mean, just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way.|b sv
A|No, no. I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way. I, I can't think that would make any difference  whether it was legal or not,|aa aa sv sv
B|Yeah. Right.|b b
A|it, it would still have to affect you the same way.|sv
B|Yeah, but, like if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean if, if, you know, that, that's the trade off.|sv
A|Oh yeah. You can't you go by their laws.|aa aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there. That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules|sv sv
B|Huh|b
A|and, uh some of the countries are very much against drugs|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and you use them, you pay for it|sv
B|Usually with you life in some places.|sv

B|Yeah. Iraq, Iran, in that area.|ny sd

A|You know, that's quite a deterrent|sv
B|Well, in Saudi Arabia, you know, using, uh, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty.|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|So, it's pretty strict over there|sv
A|Yeah. So I guess, you know, we, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how   great out country really is.|aa sv
B|Well, people tend to  take the first amendment out of context. Which, which means you know, I could do anything I want to|sv
