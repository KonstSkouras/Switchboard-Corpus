B|Real problem the last few days, one of their, uh, young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season, it was a catcher.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of, kind of late to, you know, to start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|They're not the highest paying ball team around.|sd
A|Oh no, no, they're not, are they.|aa aa qy
B|But I, you know, I would, I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you.|sd
A|Oh, goodness, I would too, even the bench warmer, I would.|ba sd sd
B|Yeah, that's right. I really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years. I used to go, take my son, you know, when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.|aa aa sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'll have to admit I kind, I kind of went more to see, to see the other team a lot of times than I did the, did the Rangers,|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|But, I think they're doing better.|sv
A|Well, I do to, uh, I have boys, you know, like eight and eleven and we go quite often, to watch the Rangers.|aa sd sd
B|Yeah, I can imagine. I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid.|b ba sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh yes, we're heavy into that too.|b aa sd
B|I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.|sv
A|Oh, I do too.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I think, uh, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, you know, yes.|sv %
B|Oh of course, of course. As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning, he just pitched his first, uh, exhibition game a day or so ago,|aa aa sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he pitched five, uh, yeah, five full innings. That was almost unheard of for a pitcher to, you know, to start out that strong.|sd sd
A|Yeah, yes, uh-huh.|b b b
B|no big deal, you know, it's just part of a day's work.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yeah, I know it, yeah, yeah.|aa sv % %
B|He's something else, he really is.|sv sv
A|He really is an, you know, as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.|sv sv
B|They could do very well, they sure could.|sv sv
A|They because I don't know but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,|% h sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.|b b b
A|I really do.|sd
B|Yeah, they've got, uh, I guess all, well all their players are signed now. Some of them are not too happy about it but there, there's no hold outs.|b % sd sv sd
A|Yeah, yeah at least, that should help,|b b sv
B|So that should help.|sv
A|it sure should.|sv
B|Yeah, it should, uh-huh.|aa sv
A|But in a way, I really do, and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.|% sd
B|Oh yeah, sure.|aa aa
A|Like Oakland A's and the Giants I really do.|sv fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Sure, sure, uh-huh, Cincinnati. Yeah, there sure are.|b b b sv % sd
A|I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.|sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's right.|b b b
A|But, uh,|%
B|I've never seen the Astros play.|sd
A|Oh you haven't?|bh
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|Oh, I have a few times.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, they're a good ball team.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|They really are.|sv
B|They sure are. Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between the Rangers and the Astros.|aa qy
A|Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it though|qh
B|Boy, I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.|ba sv
A|Wouldn't it.|qh
B|It sure would.|sv
A|Oh my goodness, we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.|ba qy
B|That's right, wouldn't that be something.|na qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|It sure would.|sv
A|That's something you dream about.|sv
B|Absolutely. But there are a lot of Ranger fans around.|aa sv
A|Oh, there sure is and, uh, that, I mean they really are. Uh, now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.|aa sv qy^d sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and, be on top.|sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah. Uh-huh, boy, he's a bull, isn't he?|b b b ba qy
A|Isn't he though,|qh
B|He really is gosh.|sv
A|he sure is. He either hits home run or strike out.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh, that's right.|aa aa
A|There is not ever a in between for him.|sd
B|That's right, it's kind of like Babe Ruth.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh, yeah.|b b
B|Yeah, they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though. Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again.|b sd sv sd
A|To sign him again, yeah. Huh.|sd % %
B|Yeah, that, you know, may or may not happen.|b sd
A|Yeah, oh you never know.|b sv
B|That's right, it's a long way away.|aa sv
A|That's sure if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.|% sv
B|That's right. That's right, unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.|aa aa sv
A|No, no, no, like that Joe Hosago you know.|aa aa %
B|Yeah, that's right.|aa aa
A|I mean, oh.|%
B|Is there going to be a ticket increase this year, price, do you know.|qy
A|I hadn't heard.|no
B|I haven't either,|sd
A|I, I really haven't, uh,|sd
B|The, uh, those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year.|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|But I didn't know, I, I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers, or I don't remember it if I have.|sd sd sd
A|Well I hadn't either,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|We hadn't, you know, like I said, we, I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.|% % sv
B|Yeah, I guess it's too early.|b sv
A|Yeah, because we usually get one. We usually order our tickets way in advance.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh, it's a good idea, yeah.|b sv %
A|We, we try to go so often.|sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah if you have young, young children, you know, they, they get a kick out of it.|b b sv
A|Oh, they do.|aa
