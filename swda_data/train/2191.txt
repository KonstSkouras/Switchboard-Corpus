B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort, and so that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, uh, the shape that I was satisfied with at least. And, uh, then I have given that up, but, uh, I would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a position that I like myself.|sd sd sd sd
