A|Been on the line for awhile. I almost forgot what the topic was.|sd sd
B|Okay. Uh, based,|b %
A|Uh, but I know what it is.|sd
B|Oh, okay. Good.|b ba
A|Uh, let me see. I, I, I, I, I'm kind of, I don't, you know, I'm, I'm kind of in the middle. I, I think it's a great idea|^h % % sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but when it comes to me, it's like, almost an insult, you know, so it's I, I've come from the teaching field.|sv % sd
B|Right. So do I|aa sd
A|So, so it's just like I don't know. I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go with, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I, I, I would, I would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, you know. If it's got to be done for everyone.|sv
B|Right. I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it should be random testing, it should be for everybody.|aa sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier|sv
A|Right. Yeah.|b b
B|I don't know, I come from the teaching field too and it sort of, uh, it's a pro and a con I don't know where to stand on it.|sd % sv h
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine, but  if, you know, if they made me then I'd probably,|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no you know just this,|sd sd
A|Yeah. You kind of goes into your privacy and you know, but I guess if they,|b ^2 sd
B|Right.|aa
A|you know, you know, there's, uh, I guess there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it.|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it, it seems to be working out so,|sv %
B|Yeah,|b
A|Yeah. Right.|b b
B|And, uh, anybody who, uh, gee, is, you know, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.|sd
A|See, that's hard.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|that's a, it's really weird issue. I'm sort of  on the fence about it.|% sv sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|But I, you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow. Oh, we can get you into a drug program. But then you wear that stigma you know|% sv ^q sv
A|Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.|b b b
B|yeah.|%
A|Then I kind of hear it goes into like, uh,|sd
B|Right. Anything with a, you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine or,|aa ^2 ^2
A|Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
B|Yeah, somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in, you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive test.|b sv
A|Um.|b
B|I know I'm an epileptic so I'd probably test positive and  and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, you know|sd sv
A|Yeah. See things like that so, Yeah.|aa sv % b
B|And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you|sv
A|Right, right. Uh-huh.|aa aa b
B|You know, it's very personal. I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because  then I'd always wonder if they fired me, you know, why did you fire me|sd sd
A|See that's, Yeah. That's where I kind of get into, cause it kind of gets into your personal life, you know. And what's kind of next.|% b sv sv qh
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|The what?|br
B|Orwell.|sd
A|Huh. Oh. Yeah.|b b b
B|and I I'd hate to have to, if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't|% sv sv
A|Right. Yeah Right.|aa b aa
B|But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train accidents and everything else.|sd
A|So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually? I kind of think they will.|qy na
B|I think they will too because, uh, you know, it's just going to follow.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know. I, we haven't had any of it in our school system. So, uh, you know  hopefully, we won't|sd sd
A|Yeah. We haven't either. Yeah. But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, you know. It's just, because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.|b sd b sv sv
B|Right. Well and eventually it's going to be not only the you know, the kids are  going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.|b aa sv
A|Yeah. Right.|b b
B|And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And then they, you know, caught everybody.|sv
A|Yeah|b
