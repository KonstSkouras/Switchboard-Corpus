A|Okay, while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of a couple of menus, so I decided it had to be in it, informal or not. You know because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. *sv|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes.|b b aa
A|Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something. I'm not I'm not into formal dinner parties, but I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.|sd sd sd
B|I see. So what do you use for cookbooks?|b qw
A|Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married, but, it's kind of the bible of cooking for me.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful You know, budget cookbooks,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did, of course I've added several different recipes,|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|but, what you serve or what would you|qw
B|Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds, uh, so the,|sd %
A|Well, that's good|ba
B|I, I, I, so, it you know, have different perspectives that you are. I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to, to fall back on,|% % sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because it has almost everything in it. But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh, it's a good reference when you need to dig something up.|sd sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK, I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs|sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, you know, the whole meal|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and so she's|%
A|that would be wonderful in these times|ba
B|yeah, now, now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes.|b sd
A|Yeah, Uh-huh.|aa
B|But they're, but they're, but they're interesting they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|%
A|What's one of your favorites?|qw
B|Um, gee, the one I had most recently was, was one that, was, she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something, and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there.|^h sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Wow, sounds too good.|b ba ba
B|Uh, and that, and that was, you know, that's, that, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes.|sd

A|Yeah, that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.|aa aa
B|THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.|sd
A|That sounds fun. I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time|ba sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I have young children, and our budget's set, you know, at this time, but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of|sd
B|Yes, yes.|aa aa
A|That's why sometimes I shy away from, uh, more of a traditional cookbook|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, well, it was interesting talking to you. It's a fun subject. Food is one of my favorite things too.|sv sv sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Anything else you wanted to add?|qo
B|Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know, what would I put together for a formal dinner. We, we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night|sd ^q sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|and, and, um, put, here, here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, um,|% sd
A|Uh-huh, that's good. Uh-huh.|b ba b
B|basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, having marinated it first and, my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh, there's a little bit of brown sugar in there, and it bakes up and it's a delicious thing, and it's easy|sd sd sd sd sd
A|That sounds good.|ba
B|comparatively. Um. I'm sorry,|sd
A|That sounds really good.|ba

A|It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am, I'm pretty simple right now, but.|sv sd %
B|Well, maybe a little more leisure time to do it.|sv
A|Yes|aa
B|I don't know,|h
A|that's probably, that's true, I have little ones and we, and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods right now.|aa sd sd

A|Yes. Yeah.|aa b
