A|Okay, all set.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
B|Good morning|fp
A|Good morning. Let's see, music, um, well, I play a couple of instruments.|fp ^h ^h sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I try to.|sd
B|What do you play?|qw
A|Um, clarinet is my primary instrument, and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Really, that's too bad|b b ba
A|How about yourself?|qo
B|I play, uh, the violin and play trumpet|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh.|b b
B|and I run a municipal band and I sometimes conduct.|sd sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|So, I'm pretty busy too. I play in three different symphony orchestras.|sd sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony.|sd
A|That's great. Uh-huh.|ba b
B|I play in the Altoona Symphony, was about forty-five miles away|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So are you a professional musician?|b b qy
B|No, I'm, uh, just retiring from Penn State University|nn sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|only I, I should, should have been. I spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I've been working at, uh, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, I understand, yeah. I'm in one community band here, and that's just, well, we rehearse once a week. We generally have a concert every other week and,|b b b ba % sd % sd sd %
B|You have one that often.|qy^d
A|Yeah|ny
B|That's amazing because I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert.|sd
A|That's a lot. No, we sure don't.|sv nn sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Well, one thing is, we have a summer summer series, and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out, outdoor stage set up|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
A|and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer,|sd
B|You are busy.|sv
A|yeah, and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements, and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um, because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.|aa sd sd
B|Where do you get all this music, I mean, you, you must back up and play some of the music twice.|qw qy^d
A|Oh yes, definitely, we really do. You know, you get your little Sousa book and you just flip through it, and that sort of thing.|qy sd sd sd
B|Oh, okay. So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then.|bk qy^d
A|It really depends on who shows up.|no
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, and it's always a mystery, because it actually doesn't matter who shows up, it matters what instruments they brought, because so many people switch instruments so often.|sd sd sd sd
B|Right. Uh-huh.|b b
A|But, um, yeah, in the winter we do more concert stuff and,|b sd %
B|How many people in your band?|qw
A|Um, I think there's about seventy.|sd
B|Seventy.|b^m
A|Yeah, there's a lot.|b sd
B|Holy mackerel, that's.|ba %
A|But, on any given night there's not seventy you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it alternates quite a lot.|sd
B|Boy, that is a huge organization, that's great.|ba sv ba
A|Yeah, it really is.|aa aa
B|Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here.|sd
A|Oh. Yeah, well.|b b %
B|But that fills a stage and keeps us busy, but they were, half have been professionals from, uh, a lot of them are from, uh, faculty at Penn State here.|sd sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|And so they want to play things that, uh, push them to do. So that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And the last one we did was in a large, uh, mall close here, we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|So that worked out very nicely.|sd
A|Yeah, that's fun.|b ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, let's see. Well, there's another band around here. Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players|^h sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and their concert schedule isn't as heavy, but they have more in the summer, I think they have ten in the summer, you know, one, one week after the other. I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.|sd sd sd sd
B|Wow, that. Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert?|ba % qy
A|Uh, well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, you know, again and again and again, but some people are,|arp_nd sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|yeah|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|some of them are.|sd
B|And where, where does this happen, Laurie, is this in Dallas?|qw qy
A|Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.|arp_nd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We're real close to Dallas.|sd
B|Well, I declare.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's amazing.|ba
A|Yeah, well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, you know.|b sd
B|Okay.|b
A|And, and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|and, That's probably why we get so many people.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this?|b qy
A|Um, well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, you know, we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events.|na sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid.|sd
B|Uh-huh. And you do have to buy your music. Who, who sponsors you basically, the city?|b qy^d qy
A|The city, uh-huh.|na ny
B|Yeah, uh, my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.|b sd
A|Yeah, it's a similar thing.|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I can't remember what they call it, but the same type of thing.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know, we can borrow music from any of the area colleges|sd sd
B|Yes.|b
A|or, you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we do an awful lot of, you know, we don't charge for any of our performances, but we get a lot of donations.|sd sd sd
B|Well, I, I work the same way|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|Well, I'll be darned. It's amazing.|ba ba
