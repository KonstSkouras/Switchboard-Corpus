A|Well, this is the season for vacations. And, uh, I guess for places I like to go, I enjoy going to the beach and having, having outdoor, being outdoors somewhere. Someplace that's very different than Texas.|sd sd sd
B|Right.|b

A|One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado, into Durango and north of the area there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I, boy that's a nice, a nice place to visit. It's really nice at, there's a nice, nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining.|% sv sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, and then actually, north, north of that is another town and, a smaller, on a smaller scale, I guess, than Silverton. But, I, and then there's lots and lots of real, of mountains that are covered with, uh, boulders.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I guess people Jeep through that area and we did not have a chance to do that. But, I sure would like to go back there and do that again.|sd sd sd
B|Right. We are, uh, we have not had a vacation in several years, so, be our first chance in awhile, uh, we are going to go to, uh, Destin, Florida, which is a very nice beach area, if you are not familiar with it.|b sd sd sd
A|I have not been, but I have heard it's wonderful.|sd sd
B|Oh, it's, it's gorgeous. Uh, we used to go quite a bit, uh, before I moved out here. We were closer and, uh, used to go almost every summer, uh, and, rent a condo there on the beach. Uh, there's quite a few, uh, there's a lot of development of, of condominiums there on the beach front.|sd sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, so they have, uh, they are very, very large condos. And, they have quite a few rooms, and, uh, so we, we will usually rent one for about a week or so. And,|sd sd %

A|Sea shells.|sd
B|Uh, there's not as many sea shells along there, uh, that's the only thing that they really do not, they have some, but not, not so much.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, if you go further down, uh, you will usually find some, but not right in there. Uh, I do not know why it is, but, uh, it just, it seems not, it seems not to have as many there, right there. But, uh, we, we enjoy it, uh, it's, the place where we stay is, we usually stay at the same place every year, and they are, like I say right on the beach. So,|sd sd % sd sd % sd sd %
A|Oh, where do you stay? My husband always wants to go to Destin, we just have not gone that direction yet.|qw sd sd
B|It's a place called Jetty East, uh, J E T T Y E A S T, and it's, uh, called that because it's at the very end of, uh, a jetty there, which is, uh, sort of at the end of this little, little point|sd sd
A|Okay.|b
B|and, uh, it's a, at the very end, it's the last set of condominiums there, and it's, uh, it's very nice.

And, uh, they have a, we have a, uh, I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, uh, condominium, which will sleep, I do not know, quite a few about , six or eight. And, uh, cause it's got, you know, pull out couches and all that,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
