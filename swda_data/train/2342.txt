B|So, uh, what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East?|qw
A|Well, actually, I think it's good. I, I, I hope that we, uh, uh, get a chance to, uh, promote peace out there, uh, because I think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices, and, and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to see stability in that area, because I'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start. Not that Desert Storm was a small one.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah Well, yeah that's probably true. I, I suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time, they're going to come from there, uh, I would think, anyway. Just seems to be that that's the most unstable part of the world, as far as I can tell.|aa aa aa sv sv
A|I saw, um, just recently, where, uh, uh, the U S is supposedly going to be, uh, putting pressure on all the, you know, the Israelis, supposedly, to come to a bargaining table to, actually I heard that the Israelis were even at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights.|sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|Yeah.|ny
B|That would be interesting because I am, actually, um, um, I'm, I'm I'm Jewish and I'm actually sort of not, not, not really a Zionist per se, you know.|sd sd
A|Okay.|b
B|But I have a, um, I have a lot of friends, you know, who are sort of adamant, you know, Israel, it's his right, and do whatever they want. And I think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing. And, you know, in some sense, the moderates may be right. They may, you know, may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down.|sd ^q sv sv sv sv
A|Well, uh, I guess it's one of those things that, uh, if it's going to really promote a lasting peace, if there is not going to be a peace,|sv
B|Right, then, then, then, then is it worth it at all.|b qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, I could the way, I mean, the only way to think about it is Well, they won, you know, they sort of took over the, um, they're one of the only countries in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war, which they didn't start, basically, so.|% sv sv sv %
A|Oh. Yeah|b b
B|So, I don't, I don't know how to, I don't, I don't know what to do about it But I think that, that you know, in general the region is really in bad shape|sd sv
A|Do you think the U S is going to wind up keeping, uh, military bases over there?|qy
B|Um, probably, oh, isn't, isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something?|na qy
A|I, I haven't heard that. I watch C N N every once in a while, but, I, I haven't specifically heard anything about that.|^h ^h ng
B|I just heard something about moving, recently, about moving, um there, there, there's some central command post in Tampa I think that they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East. Actually, there was, um, a small country or small city, I think, or even, not actually in Saudi Arabia or anything, but a little bit off to the, um, east of it, I think. And I, they want to keep something over there, so that they don't have to, um, I guess it's, I guess it's sort of so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something. I'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it. But they want to keep some sort of central command post there.|sd sd sd % sv sd sd sv
A|What I thought was interesting is that, uh, apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|And, uh, then I guess there's still the possibility that, uh, hostilities with, uh, U S troops could still break out.|sv
B|Yeah, that's, they claim that's why we're still there. I mean, you know, why only, you note it's only, only a small number of people have actually come back yet.|b % sv % qy^d
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I think that's actually the scariest part, because when, in the way, what, what's happening in Iraq right now, you know, in itself, it being so crazy there. I have no idea, I mean, what do you know, just to imagine that one day they're just going to turn around and someone is going to say, We don't like you, and start attacking again, and it's going to be worse. I don't know. Um.|sv h % sd sv h

B|I was there a couple of years ago, when it wasn't, you know, sort of dangerous to be out there, I guess.|sd

A|Yeah. Yeah Okay, well you know, do you have a lot of Kosher foods there at your house?|b b b % qy
B|Yeah, actually my house is Kosher, but it turns out that one of the strangest things about, about Israel is that um, most folks don't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of, you know, Jewish food and so forth. Um, and, you know, um, in general it really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel. So you typically think of it, like bagels, right, you know, bagels and lox.|b sd sv sv sv ^g sd
A|Yeah|ny
B|Turns out, you don't, you don't, you don't really find bagels in Israel. What you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods. The same foods that you find in, um, Syria and Egypt and everything else. Eastern Have you ever had those?|sd sd sd qy

A|Oh really. I dated, uh, I dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago, and I was the only Goyim at, at all the Seder dinners and everything, and I used to have to go with rolls of, not, pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me|b sd sd sd

A|Okay.|b
B|But I, um, I sort of, you know, do a lot of these things, so, so that, um, Seder, our first Seder is tomorrow night. And this is a rare exception. There are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night, which, and five of them will be Jewish.|sd % sd sd sd sd

A|Wow|ba
B|And I was the only Jew both nights.|sd
A|Oh really|b
B|So, which to me is wonderful, because it means that people who never would get to see this, um, so get to see it. And my view is, Passover is, should sort of be, in, in, in, in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway, because it, it sort of predates Christ.|sv sv sv

A|Did you?|qy
B|Yeah, every year, I try and catch that. But yeah. That's what always amazes me, actually, is that, um, is that, you know, my wife and I always sort of bring this up about her being Syrian, you know, and my being Jewish, you know. We look alike, we act alike, we sound alike, well, not totally alike but you know. Um, um, it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other.|ny sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd sv
A|Well, that's, to me it's really, um, I guess, I guess I can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that. But, you know, emotionally I have a real difficult time believing that, uh that, that people that believe in God and love, not war and to forgive can't get together.|% sv sv sv

I mean, I, I, knowing the history I understand that, the hatred of the Muslims for, you know, the Israelis or whatever, and I can sort of handle that and , but I sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves.|b sv sd % sd sd sv
