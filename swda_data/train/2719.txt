B|Oh, it's uh, scaled back considerably. Uh, right now my exercise is pretty much limited to, uh, softball league and occasional ride on the bike, but uh, I uh, I was just recently, well, recently nine months ago, got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot.|no sd sd sd

B|Right.|b

B|Wow.|ba
A|And uh, she said, you know, the most conservative approach, you do the medicine, you do the medicine again and again, before you think of surgery.|sd

B|Oh, that, it's so aggravating to uh, to have an injury like that. My wife, uh, runs or likes to run, but uh, she's, well, we moved, we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area.|% sv sd % sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|Yeah, and she started running down there and all the hills.|ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she lasted about two weeks, and her ankles couldn't take it anymore. She was used to running, you know flat tracks and whatnot, and uh, ever since that, it's just been real difficult. It's real aggravating, because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff. Even if she does get on flat ground, so she's kind of in the same mode. She was all ready to get back into it and start running, uh five K's, and ten K's and stuff this spring, and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape. And, when you want to do it, it's really, really aggravating. You know, it, it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise, and it's another thing to, to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sv sv sv

A|It's depressing.|sv
B|Uh-huh, it is, and you know, you, you don't well. Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising, and uh, it's really, it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff, it, your body just gets used to it. Yeah, I, I don't particularly enjoy it. Well I, I used to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that. I do enjoy riding bike, but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that. Uh, I, I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much, but once I got used to it, it was habit forming. It was, I felt so bad if I didn't, physically, I mean I just, my body was, was, was uh, tuned into that, that mode, and if I, if I skipped it then it kind of threw the, the whole, the whole system out of whack.|b aa % sd sd sv % sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd % sd sd

B|Yeah, it is. Uh, we're on, we're on a little street called Bison Trail. It's only about a block and a half long, but it's, it's over on the other end. It, it's over by the far edge of, uh, Stephen's Park Golf Course.|ny sd sd sd sd sd

And uh, we have, well, we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and, all that kind of stuff. So, it's a lot of fun and it is, it's a really beautiful area.

B|Okay. Oh, wow.|b ba
A|And I just loved the neighborhood.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I mean, everyone, everyone had houses like that. They were all completely different.|sd sd

B|Yeah, ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big, oh, I guess, it's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch.|b sd

B|Next door, we've got an Austin stone. Across the street, the guy, it was burnt out about two years ago and, and the guy moved in and completely redid it's got, oh, it's got a rounded front on it. It's all brick, and he's, he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that. So, yeah, there's a variety, you just don't see it anywhere else, as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot.|sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd
A|Now, why couldn't your wife run around the golf course? Is that not good?|qw qy
B|Oh, she could, a little bit. We, I tell you what, we got into the fitness center at Methodist and they have a quarter mile track there. So she has started doing that rather than uh, rather than take off. The problem is she's a school teacher and for her, she can't run in the morning. For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night, in the winter time, it's starting to get dark and, you know, you don't want to, she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas. Regardless whether it's north Dallas or whatnot, when she goes over to this fitness center, it's fenced in, and there's somebody in the building, watching her and all that, so there's a lot of consideration.|sd % fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd
