A|But, uh, yeah, I need to start jog something again. I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise, but it's terribly boring, and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.|b sv sv sv sd
B|Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?|qy
A|No, I never have. Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries I usually only go about a mile or two.|nn sd sv sd
B|I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.|sd
A|Yeah, it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.|b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.|sv
B|Yeah, that's not quite so so easy.|b sv
A|You have to have the right, type of shoes too, that's, very important.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah. I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .|b b sd
A|But, Yeah, I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much use|% b sd sd
B|Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.|sv
A|Uh-huh. I usually enjoy the exercise I do but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program. So I'll, I'll bicycle I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile, but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week. But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,|b sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit, I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.|sd sd
B|Yeah, well, don't let it collect dust. At least exercise while dusting it off|b ad ad
A|Yeah.|b
B|well.|b
A|Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.|sd
B|Yeah, that, that'll be good.|b ba
A|I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise, an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And that was very helpful we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
