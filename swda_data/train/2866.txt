A|well, Myrna, how do you get your news, news?|qw
B|Uh, most of it is from the radio, uh, and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|We usually watch the local news and the, the, uh, national news both.|sd
A|Uh-huh, yeah, I'm pretty much the same. I, uh, I find that, uh, I'm a graduate student and I, I read a lot for school and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I just, I'm reading so much all the time. And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.|b b sd % sd sd sd sd
B|Well you can always get up and leave that|sv
A|Uh-huh, yeah, that's true.|aa aa
B|Uh, I I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper. Either by the time I get home from work, it's already, you know, time for the news to come on.|sd % sd
A|Uh-huh. That's right, yeah.|b aa aa
B|So, it's so much easier to sit there and besides, I can be doing other things and still listen to the news.|sv sd
A|Yeah, that's right, I, I agree. That's, a lot of times I eat while I'm uh, watching the news.|aa aa aa % sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah, the same thing. Is there any, uh, what did you think about the coverage like over in the, uh, Persian Gulf?|b^m sd qy qo
B|I think they did a great job.|sv
A|Yeah, I thought so too, it was, it, you know, for a while when we were really interested, uh, we saw it all the time. Some of the stations I guess carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good.|aa aa % sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time.|sv sv
A|Yeah, right, yeah, just news, that's right, yeah.|aa aa aa aa aa aa
B|Yeah, I noticed that one thing that, that T I did, you know, they had, uh, uh, they used to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,|b^m sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they used to have a program called T News, and just updates of, of different things that were going on within T I. Well when all the, the mess with, uh, uh, in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N.|sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Well now, they have had so much good response from this, that T I now has C N N on all the time.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Huh, well that's great.|b ba
B|So, we can always run upstairs and, you know, get a quickie update on what's going on, if we really want to.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, or if you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.|b aa sv
B|Yeah, yeah|aa aa
A|Yeah, that's really good. That's, um, I've found that when I, I don't have cable television anymore, uh, when I moved, went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to buy, rent a cable T V line, or whatever, you know. So I don't get C N N, uh, which was a big disappointment. I used to watch, that was my, if I wasn't home, I'm a college teacher and sometimes I teach in the evening so I'll miss the evening news. And uh, you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N. I think that's, that really has changed the way, uh, I look at the news.|b^m ba sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd sv sd
B|Yes Yeah, we don't get it either, we live out in the country,|aa b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we just don't have it available out there where we are. But when we did have it, uh, we, that's what we usually watched, was C N N|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.|sd
A|Yeah, that's, uh, same, yeah, that's, when I had it, I, I watched it, you know, religiously for half an hour and then you could go on, you know, to do what else you wanted to do.|b % % % sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah I find I, I read very little, I don't even get a regular newspaper and, uh, because, uh, I, I don't drive that much, I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work, I, uh, I find I spend so little time in the in the car that I don't really listen to the radio, you know, I don't, so. So television is my main new source.|b^m sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, I get that too, because I, I'm in a van pool,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yes, yes.|ny ny
A|Oh.|bk
B|And in the, in the morning I try to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty. But in, but in the afternoon, uh, I try to read so I can, can, uh, not pay attention to what our driver is doing|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, I can, the van pools I know that, and I'm in the Baltimore, Washington area, and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas, but if you want a nicer home, you know, beyond the suburbs, you know, I, that's necessary.|b % % sd sd sd % sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh, it's, um, it's funny, there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington, even though they're so close. There's only an hour, less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values and, um, the closer you get to D C the more expensive it is.|b^m sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, the, the, uh, different slant. Washington, it really is a, uh, uh, an international city, where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore. You know, it, there's really, uh, most people have relocated to the Washington area, you know.|sd sd % sd
B|Oh no, I'd, I'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere.|ba sd
A|Yeah, that's, I, I like it, I like it a little bit better, too. It's interesting though, um, to meet different populations. I, I'm just now being, uh, from Pittsburgh originally, I'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and I find that really interesting, you know, to imagine, here is somebody that was in China, two years ago when all that was going on in, in, uh, Beijing. You know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective. But I, I really much, much like the hometown area, yeah. And I think that also goes, it's funny, you, you can watch different news. I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and I really do watch Baltimore news. You know, that really makes, I don't really bother with the Washington station because I just, it's so far removed from what I'm interested in.|aa % sd sd sd sd sv sd sv % % % % sd sd sd sd % sd
B|Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is, is the crime problems that they're having there.|sv
A|Uh-huh, yeah they, in fact they just, it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics, um, they had to impose a curfew that, uh, in two of the areas in, uh, in the Washington suburbs. The mayor, they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then, uh, brought in,|aa aa sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, I heard about that.|b sd
A|Yeah, and then came a woman that's um, she's big in the Democratic party so that's good, so she has good national ties, but she also was, um, something like a, uh, state auditor or something like that before this position. She was a state auditor, I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia, at Washington. And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor, so she's uh, fiscally she's pretty tight, and, uh, she's cleaning house an, and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job, uh, for Washington, you know, which is, you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there. You know, from what I pick up on the news, uh, it's a difficult process, you know, to get rid of a, a bad mayor.|b sd sd ba sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sv
