A|Okay, is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
B|No. Actually I'm a spectator, and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf.|nn sd sd
A|Uh-huh. My husband likes golf also, he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it But he, he limits it pretty good. I, um, have tried to go out and play golf. He would love it if I would go out and play with him, but I stand there and swing and swing,|b sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I can't even hit the ball|sd
B|I can't even play miniature golf well.|sd
A|Yeah, I don't either|b sd
B|Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not, but I am very good at watching it on television.|sv sd
A|Right.|b
B|And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments. He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,|sd sd
A|Oh, so he's really into it.|bf
B|Oh, yeah, he was a good golfer.|aa sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But, uh, golf tended to be I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports.|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers, and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.|sd sd
A|Right, more because of their personalities than their sportsman|b qy^d
B|Uh-huh. Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship. Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for so you know, the competitor, and I became involved in following his career.|b arp_nd sd sd sd
A|Right|b
B|And, uh, I know that, that my husband, Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And he thought he was spectacular. I said, Whoa. I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him. So I decided Andy Bean was good competition|sd sd ^q sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television, and I followed Andy Bean.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.|sd
A|Oh, he's interesting.|sv
B|He is.|aa
A|I like to watch him.|sd
B|He is a character not just a golfer,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but he's quite a character.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models.|sv
A|Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.|aa aa aa
B|And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model in any field, any sports.|sv
A|Yeah. I like to watch those skins games.|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know, for each hole they win they get the money for it.|qy sd
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|I think those are pretty exciting.|sv
B|Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf. You hit a little ball, you chase it, you go find it, and then you hit it again and lose it again.|sd sv sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh, yeah.|aa aa
B|And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole, but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.|sv sv
A|Oh really I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.|b sd
B|Oh, I know. Oh, yeah.|aa b
A|My husband and his buddies are not very good. They play like maybe once a month or less|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|and so they all hit like in the low nineties, and they think they're having a really good game|sd sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|So.|%
B|Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|so he wasn't bad.|sv
A|Yeah, that is good.|aa ba
B|He was pretty good, but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age. You can't play football at fifty-five.|sv sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh, anything can be warped.|sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Something to stay active at for a long time.|b sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's right, that's right.|aa aa aa aa
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years.|sv
A|Yeah, and they can still get good at it.|aa sv
B|That's right, that's absolutely right. And it's something that,|aa aa %
A|Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,|sd
B|Yeah, when you're too old to do anything else go play golf,|b sv
A|Yeah|b
B|yeah But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles.|sv
A|True.|ba
B|You know, you can go to the country club together. You can play with your friends, he can play with his friends, but you've both been out and exercised, and you have enjoyed the day.|sv sv sv sv sv
A|Right, yeah. Or my favorite, just ride around in the cart with him|aa aa sd sv
B|You bet, you get a lot of exercise that way.|ba sv
A|Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course.|sv
B|Uh-huh, well, I'll tell you what, if if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long.|aa sv
A|Oh, yeah. But my husband's pretty tolerant, so he's not too bad to watch.|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh, mine had a very short fuse. If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it.|b sd sd
A|Oh, no, yeah.|ba %
B|He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls. I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal.|sd sd
A|Gosh. Now my husband has a temper, but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course. He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff.|ba sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
A|So I guess he's real laid back about it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He, he'll come home though, and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds, and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything .|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, well I shot in the hundreds, but I made this one good one|b ^q ^q
A|Yeah, this one, on this one hole Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way|aa ^q qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|those are, it's hard for me to, act nice about that when it goes on and on,|sd
B|Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|Membership in the clubs is expensive, the equipment is very expensive, requires special shoes, requires special, you know, special equipment. There's so many,|sv sv sv sv sv
A|Right, and then they want to play another course that's not, they're not a member of|aa sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|and other fees.|sv
B|That's right, that's right.|aa aa
A|It really is high.|sv
B|It can get very expensive, and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing.|aa sd
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|And they don't give those sessions away. And nor do they give, uh, instructions away.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf. I said I don't know, I'll have to try it and see. I've always watched it.|sd sd ^q ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he said, well, fine, he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|If you do, then we can go golf together.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, whoa, great, I get to walk all around a little green field all day. But those kinds of things happen, though, you, you get a little taste of it and you say, Hey, this is not bad.|ba ba sd sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you really begin to develop an interest in it. But I am not an athlete at all.|sv sd
A|Me either.|sd
B|You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball. So I am not an athlete. Maybe golf is a forgiving sport. I don't know.|sd sd sd h
A|Yeah at least you're just you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there.|b sv
B|It doesn't appear to be Uh-huh. I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it, but I'm open to try anything, you know.|sv aa sd sd
A|Yeah that's, kind of the way I feel.|b sd
B|The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so I'm going to have to golf in the evening or I'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I don't think the,|%
