B|Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all, uh, uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I, uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game.

A|Yeah, I like that too. I don't know I try to play, but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy. I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy. And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come and then I got worse again so.|b sd h sd sd sv sv sd %

B|So I'm pretty bad but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, across the ground, and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm, but I'm getting better. I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|Um, I'm that and worse. I, I play next year I, actually I take it kind of seriously but I've been doing so bad. Next year, I always say this every year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch. I'm going to go take lessons and everything. I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not.|sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd
B|Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something. Because I, my, my tee off is not bad, I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just, that, that initial tee|sv sd sd sd
A|Yeah, what do you do when you're putting? That's a good thing. That's something I could learn actually. That's when I do my worst. I finally get to the green and I think I'm doing all, all fine and then,|b qw sv sv sd sd sv %

B|Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, you know, because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, but you can feel that?|b qy

B|The, the, it's, it's like I said once I get up on the green I'm fine, but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know, when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole but,|% sd sd sd sd sd %
