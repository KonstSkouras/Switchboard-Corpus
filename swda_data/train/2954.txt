B|Yeah. It was kind of fun. But, uh, but who was it? A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend. And it really sounded like it was fun. But, I am not quite sure what I would do. I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace, and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know. And have different areas to explore and things like that.|b sd ^h sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|So that would be kind of fun. Yep. Where nobody lives|sd b sd
A|Right.|b
B|But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.|sd
A|Yeah. And they do not have to clean up afterwards.|b sd

B|That sounds, is, does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there?|ba % qy
A|Uh, it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.|% na
B|Well, that is pretty big|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do not know how they do scale down there. You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.|sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|Yeah. Because they, is this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres. As opposed to tens of acres.|b % % sd
A|Yeah. And, uh, and most of it, you know, you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.|b % % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We kind of have a, an informal contest. My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago. Well, he put some crappie too. But the bass, we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet. So,|sd sd sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they are in there, but they are real spooky.|sd
B|Yeah. I think my dad put some. We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too. And, I mean really little.|b sd sd % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in, and there were too many little goldfish, and so the big ones never got bigger.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again|sd
A|Never saw the bass?|qy^d
B|No.|nn
A|Oh.|bk
B|So we do not know whether it is living or,|sd %
A|Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.|sv
B|Yep.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|We still have lots of little goldfish. They propagate pretty well, those little fish.|sd sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah,|b
A|they really do.|sd
B|because we started, we have got hundreds in there now, and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know, no matter how many it was for a dollar.|% sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.|sd
A|Oh,|b
B|And,|%
A|yeah.|b
B|It,|%
A|They there is a, uh, you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there. I do not know if they would live very well up in New York, but they get huge. And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.|% % ad sd sd sd
B|Oh, okay. Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too|bk sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, yeah. We could see. I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way. But catfish do, I think.|b sd sd sd
A|Yeah. They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.|b sd
B|Uh-huh. So, that, you mean, well, we could try it. That is a good idea.|b % % sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh, I forget, there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.|sd ^h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish. And it was really funny, because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond, and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish. And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond And that night he came out, and the trap was gone. And it was a raccoon that had taken it. So it was really funny.

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so,|%
A|Yeah. That is what happens|b sd
B|But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?|qy

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|That is funny.|ba
A|But they come up to the top. And it is the best time to take pictures, because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water. And they're,|sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.|sd
B|Uh-huh. I have never seen catfish, you know, except in filleted on a plate, I think maybe. I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I have never seen them, just alive someplace. That would be fun to see.|sd sd
A|Well, they are really funny fish.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they try to hit you with their tails.|sd
B|How big do they get?|qw
A|Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh, I think the world record is fifty some pounds. Uh,|sd sd %
