B|when you're getting paid millions to do it, you I think they take it to another level.|sv

B|who's that? Notre Dame|qw qy

B|Yeah. It's just, it's four yards, three yards eight yards, tackle.|b sv
A|Right.|b
B|That's, you know, it gets kind of monotonous. After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just, just to  juice it up a little bit|sv sv
A|Sure.|b
B|and but,|%
A|Well, I think they're starting to realize that. A lot of the, like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.|sv sv

A|Yeah, whatever you want to call it there.|b h
B|Yeah. That's some brutal stuff there. That's, that's worse than football as far as violence I think. Golly. Those guys kill each other out there. Rugby is something else.|b sv sv ba sv sv
