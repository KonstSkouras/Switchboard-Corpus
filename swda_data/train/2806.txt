B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and anyway, he just, he went and found this guy in, in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in, I guess in in Mexico, I don't know where. But anyway he brought this home and I looked at him and I said you've got to be kidding, I'm not going to live with a lizard|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yuck!|ba
A|But you know I visualize that animal racing about, and you know, like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that. They're very much like, uh, well, the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes.|sd sd sv sd sd
B|Did you have him in a cage?|qy

A|It was, he was really a neat pet and though I, you know, he'd when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes|sd % % sd
B|Oh!|ba
A|And it, it was a long time before I could really pet him and, but I fed him and he, he knew how to get me to feed him. He'd come out to the kitchen, just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh. Oh no, I mean you don't argue with an iguana, do you.|% ba qy
A|But he was really a neat animal. He, he'd lay in Dan's lap, you know, and just, uh, when he'd pet him, he'd just stretch and, you know, you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does.|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|It was kind of interesting. But he did a lot of interesting things and, uh, Dan carried him around and he liked to ride on the back of his, up on his head, you know, with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off, an, and scare everybody to death and kids loved him,|sv sd sd sd sv
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|kids just loved him. Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him and, and he tolerated them, you know. He'd even tolerate him petting though, he didn't like them too well at first, but he, he got tame, you know, so that, uh, people could go in there. And Dan was a drummer,|sv sd sd sd sd sd sv sd

B|Oh.|b
A|and he was so funny. Uh, for a while they built a, a run for him out to the side of the house, you know. He'd been on the patio but they put the run out there, and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him. And one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and, and Hal and I were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and, and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air And then bark and march around, you know,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
