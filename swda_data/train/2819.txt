B|I guess I'm like my parents. The younger generation gets away with hell, but, uh,|sd sv %
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because I've changed. You know, I used to live up north. Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant|sv sd sd sv

A|Oh, really?|bh
B|In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think,|sv
A|Yeah, uh you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do.|b sv
B|Yeah, I think it's, crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years,|b % sv
A|Oh, yeah, I agree.|aa sd
B|and maybe that has a lot to do with it.|sd

B|Yeah, that's true.|aa ba
A|So,|%
B|That's true,|ba

B|I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved|sd

A|Yeah, that's for sure.|aa ba
B|You can't, you can't make it,|sv

B|I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a, get a home and buy house, and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever|sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah|b b
B|you know, you just don't buy a house,|sv
A|just because they can't get into one, yeah, that's right. Yeah, the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways,|^2 aa ba b sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so. Yeah, that's, that's a good point so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years.|b ba ^h
B|Yeah, for me it's kind of hard, I don't know. I think, I don't know, I think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding|b sd h % sv
A|Oh, yeah, I agree.|aa aa
B|and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around.|sv
A|Well, I hope so, you know, at some point but I don't know at what point,|sd sd
B|But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, uh|sv
A|Yeah,|b
B|so, usually is I think.|sv
A|Yeah. It's, uh,|b %
B|It's hard for me to say. I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those that gets caught. But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs to be, be changed.|sd sd sv
