B|I haven't seen a whole lot either,|sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Somehow, I mean it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive, you know, I'd, I'd rather rent.|b b % sd sd
B|I know it's it's obnoxious, because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket,|ba sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but then you end up spending another six dollars on food.|sd
A|Yeah and that's just for a a bucket of popcorn, you know.|b sd
B|And a pop, you know, so it's, it gets pretty,|^2 %
A|Yeah, yeah, God forbid you should want something to drink with it, but, uh.|aa aa sd %
B|Yeah like if I, so if I take a date, it, it cost me, you know, twenty bucks, easy.|b % sd

B|And, uh, I don't know.|h
A|And you're usually going to do, you're usually going to go to a dinner, go to dinner or something with that.|sv
B|I was going to say, you, you know, you can find certain restaurants that are nice, and have good food for eat for thirty dollars.|sd
A|Yeah. It's almost more fun really, yeah, it's almost more fun really to rent movies. You know, just kind of stay at home, maybe.|b sv % sv
B|Yeah, the problem is you always have to wait until they're out.|b sv
A|Yeah, that's true too.|aa aa
B|So that's what you're, you're, uh, dealing with.|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well.|%
A|Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently|sd

A|Oh, yeah, that was great.|b sd
B|Oh, did you see that?|qy
A|Yes, that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too, that was an excellent movie. It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital, uh, near to where I live and they were saying that some of the patients there, you can't leave by themselves, because they'll make a weapon out of anything, you know, out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody, you know.|ny sd sd sd sd sd

B|Has he had, has he had very many other movies out?|qy
A|He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE and there was one right before that with a similar title like, uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title. That's why, I, I just don't like the,|na sd sd sd
B|Because it's a macho movie.|bf
A|yeah, it is, I, I don't like that a lot. I don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either.|% % sd sd
B|Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out.|sd

B|I don't know, I've enjoyed a lot of his movies,|h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, they just, they're action filled, and a little bit of humor,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|and, uh.|%
A|I guess, I'm not fond of the action packed movie, where they're always chasing or fighting, or, you know,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I like the more, movies that make you think.|sd
B|Yeah, did you ever see, um, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?|b qy

A|Yeah, a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay, you know,|b sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|it wasn't anything spectacular.|sd
B|You expect more out of, uh, Julia Roberts, though.|sv
A|Yeah, the previews looked so good that I wanted to see it but I never did, uh.|b sd sd
B|Did you ever see the original F X movie.|qy
A|well I saw half of it, and I remember I was in school, I saw half of it and I fell asleep and everyone else watched it|sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh, yeah.|b %
B|you get these twists and, it's usually pretty good, but, uh.|sd sd %
A|I think, I think though, that movies are losing their luster.|sv
B|What's that?|br
A|I think movies are losing their attractiveness, just to a lot of people. Just, I think, I don't know, because of the cost and, I think it, it's just losing its originality or something. I don't, I can't pin, pinpoint it.|sv % % h sd sv % sd
B|Yeah, yeah|b b
A|But it doesn't seem like it's as big, uh, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be.|sv
B|That's probably true. I, I, I just you see the same story lines, different characters|aa % sv
A|Uh-huh, yeah, exactly.|aa aa aa

A|Right.|b
B|But, uh, I don't try to just for that reason, it is a, it does cost a lot,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so why go out and see something right away, you know, you kind of wait and if something gets really good reviews, maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks, you know to go to it.|qh sv sv
