A|and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And keep your mind on positive things and, and stress that to your children.|ad ad

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.|sv sv
B|Absolutely. Well, I would agree with that. We're also real active in our church and my kids do an awful lot with that. Allyson sings in the choir. I told her that's a gift from God and you need to return that back.|aa aa sd sd sd sd ^q
