A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know, but not very often do I read the whole thing. Quite often just scan through the headlines and,|sd sd sd sd %

A|it, I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers. It just seems like I was so busy all the time, and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, uh, things like that|% sd sd sd

B|Yeah. That's true.|b ba
A|You know.|%
B|I wanted a little more detail like, you know, they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were. And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.

A|when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought that was very interesting, and I thought that was very important for kids. Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.|sd sd sd
