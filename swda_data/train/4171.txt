B|Yeah, the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive. It's like hundred bucks a, a month or something for a family.|b sd sd
A|Yeah. Huh, well, I guess what we have is like a what they call a flex benefits plan where you, you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, you know, put in your paycheck.|b sd sd sd
B|Yeah, we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, uh, they'll basically pay for, uh, you know, child care type, uh, expenses. I can send in a, uh, can send in a request for payment and they'll, uh, and they'll send me, a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good, you know. It's, uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something.|b sd sd sd sv sd
A|Yeah well, it depends on which company you work for. I know that, like, the, the, the one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, uh, you know, you, uh, think you call it plan D another example like I guess it's alzheimer's Deductibles are really high, it's like fifteen hundred dollars, but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely, if you're relatively, uh, healthy, then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much, amount of money, you know. So, it, someone did start a cost benefit analysis, and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and, and take a loss, whatever happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual|b sv sd sd sd sv sd sd
B|Yeah, I guess, uh, on the other hand, you know, I, I had a similar, had a similar health plan and, uh, one of my kids was in a car accident and, uh I had, wound up having to pay for, you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, you know, no, no insurance policy happened to cover it, which is,|b aap_am sd sd sd
A|Um. Really? You mean, not even your, your, your car insurance?|% bh bf
B|Well, it, it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here, and, and I had a high deductible on the on the, uh, on the car insurance and then you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it|sd sd sd
A|Oh, that's too bad.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
