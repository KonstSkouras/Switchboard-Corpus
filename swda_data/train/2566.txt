B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I had her at a private sitter for, I guess, two, two and a half years after that.|sd
B|And how did you choose that sitter?|qh
A|Um, she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful. I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't think.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I didn't want to send her straight to a day care.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, even though she was that old, I still didn't want her to go to a day care.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And this lady, you would think it was her own.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah. She's real good.|ny sd
B|It's hard to find people like that.|sv
A|Yes. It is. And, um, now I have got her in a Montessori school.|aa sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she's really, really doing good and learning a lot. And, actually, I've started working up there in the afternoons, too. So,|sd sd %
B|Oh, yeah. Well, that's neat.|b ba
A|well, yeah. I guess. I'm going to quit as soon as school, the school season's over. But, uh, I really enjoyed being with her up there. I hate it for her, she has to stay that much longer,|aa sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but,|%
B|Do they have classes for them during the summer, too?|qy
A|Yeah. They, they go uh, year-round, uh teach them.|ny sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Now, in the summer they have like a lot of field trips.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one, and stuff like that. It's a lot more lax. But, but they still go through all their, uh, curriculum as usual.|sd sd sd
B|What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there?|qw
A|Um, gosh I my husband and I both went. We kind of give her the third degree|^h % sd sd
B|Uh, good I'm glad to hear that.|ba sd
A|Yeah. Well, we went over to her house, so we told her, you know, well, we didn't tell her, we just told here we'd be over that day. We didn't tell her when. So, that way I didn't think,  you know, the house would be, you know, cleaned or anything for me specifically.|b sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Right.|b b
A|And, um, she had a daughter, and I want to say her daughter was like six or seven, right around first, second grade. And, um, at the time she kept one other child, um, about a four year old, I believe. But it was only like a part-time basis. So, we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and, um, what she did with them during the day and, um, you know, just how she treated them, how, how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and  stuff like that|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, we really seem to be pleased with her. And, um,|sd %
B|Did you, did you introduce your daughter to her before you made,  your decision?|qy
A|Yes, Oh, yes. And she still loves her to death. I,  mean, when they see each other, you know, they just love each other to death. And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or,  buying her things.|ny ny sd sd sd
B|Really? Yeah.|bh b
A|So, we're real, real lucky. But uh, so she stayed with her about, roughly two years, and she, um, she had to go back to work, they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go, I guess, get a real job|sd % sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Get a real job, full time.|b bf
A|Yeah. So, uh,|aa %
B|So, what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school?|qw
A|Well, I checked a lot of places out, you know, the Kinder Cares and the,  stuff like that. And, uh, I live in Garland. And, there's this Montessori school that's nearby and, um, it had been recommended by some friends of ours but, uh, it, it's an older place. And so, I, uh, checked out all the new places that were near us and then I checked that place out and, uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and,  I guess, kind of homey.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|And they didn't just play all day long. You know, like, I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went asked: Can I have some Jell-O? Speaker A answered: and interviewed on, or interviewed at, um, they did a lot of play work and stuff. And then they, almost all of them had a Montessori section.|sd sd % sd
B|Huh.|b
A|And I thought, well, gosh, that must be pretty good, you know, if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into,  into,  their school.|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|And they made sure they pointed it out, you know. But after I looked at this place, and I took Randi with me, uh, I think just about to every place. One place I think I didn't take her.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I just kind of let her go, see, see what she felt like doing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that place, boy, if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and, it's hard to drag her away So, I felt more comfortable at,  that place.|sd sd sd
B|That's,  the true test.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And she was real comfortable. And she has really, really done good. I, I, it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her.|sd sd % sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, she seems to me to be, you know, pretty quick and smart and she's already reading and writing and stuff,  like that.|sd sd
B|That's good.|ba
A|And she just turned five last month.|sd
B|Huh, that,  is good then.|ba
A|So, Yeah. I think so. I mean, I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time, but,|% aa sd sd sd
B|No, especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years,  in school|aa sv

B|Yeah, really|b b
A|And, oh, my God. Here we go,  you know.|ba

B|Yeah. Yeah. I have a nephew. He's a little brat. He goes to a really crummy day school. My sister's not real bright, so, but he, he's always sick. I mean, he has always got some kind of, cold or something. And, I don't know, I don't think this place is a very good place for him. It's just kind of convenient and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else.|ny ny sd sd sd sd sd sd h sd sd sd

B|Oh, yeah. That's right. I think that's an ideal situation.|ba ba sv
A|Because you don't know, uh, because like at her school, um, as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive They sit and they have car callers and, and some kid goes out and gets the kid and,  it's time to go|sv sd sd sd sd sd

A|But now that I'm there, I mean, it's, it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. You know, when their parents come,|sd
