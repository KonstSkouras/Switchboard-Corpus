A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|and, uh, it's about sixteen hundred square feet,  which is fine for the two of us.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|But it, it, you know, we looked at a lot of houses that were, had more square footage,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they didn't use it right, you know.|sd
A|Right, uh-huh.|b b
B|It was a bunch of empty, you know, hallway and stuff that|sd

B|Yeah, yeah, really. So we've used every bit of it and our house, um, we bought it for sixty-four,|aa aa aa sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|and, uh, the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy-five,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, you know, I think we were you know, got a good deal on it.|sd

A|My father used to live in Dallas, uh, now, he, he went back to New Jersey, we're originally from the East. But he,|sd sd sd %
B|Oh really, my husband's from New Jersey|b sd
A|oh, really, he, uh, well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island, he lived in New Jersey for a while, now he's in Rhode Island. And, uh, he used to like to go, and we used to go, just every weekend just to look at houses, for no reason, we weren't buying one every weekend, but just to look at them. And so I got a pretty good feel of, you know, what I want when I do, you know, get my house, whenever that is, um. What was I going to say about that, I completely lost my train of thought. Um, but we, we enjoy going looking at houses and, and, uh, we now, I kind of have a good idea of what I want. I know I want a big family area,|b sd sd sd sd sd t1 sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, that's what we were looking for the first thing.|aa sd
A|uh, yeah, fire, a fireplace, I saw this awesome house the other weekend, it was a great big family room and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard, and it had a built in, uh, grill and every,|b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|I mean, it was, it was just, an the ultimate party room, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah.|b b
A|I was just going I could have a party in here. But that's pretty nice.|sd sd
B|But that's what we had, uh, uh, that's what we had looked for, was our main concern was a big living room,  you know, and big closet space, you know.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Right, yeah I like a lot of closet space, I don't like because, I don't like to have a lot of things out, you know, just all over the place,|b aa aa sd sd sd
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|I like to have them kind of tucked away.|sd
B|And, uh, so that's, that's what we went for first and, and it, you know, we, we don't, we just have a big living room an, and a dining room is separate,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, some places have, like the house next door to us that we looked at,  had a living room, a dining room and a den.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|But to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, we opted for the just, the whole wide room,  that went from one end of the house to the other, just about.|sd
A|Uh-huh. My father had, uh, I keep talking about my father because he owned a house, uh, he had the kitchen, kind of a kitchen and a very long family room,|b sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|it's just kind of one room and what he did, he put, uh, a bar right in the center,  and put some, uh, a glass rack down, so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and it just kind of, it kind of separated it. It was still, you know, together, but it just looked a lot better. Because I personally don't like the combination rooms.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, right, I, but I, I think for where we are,  um, I think we got a real good deal on it|aa aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we, you know, we have a, uh, the backyard is just huge.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It is just really, I think another house could fit back there.|sd sd
A|Yeah, I'd like a big backyard.|b sd
B|And, uh, we really liked it, of course, when you have to mow it  You know in, uh, middle of August, it's, it's kind of,  a little hot,|sd sd
A|Oh really. A little hot.|b ^2
B|yeah.|aa
A|Try to do it early in the mornings.|ad
B|But, uh, it's, it's nice and that was, you know, a big selling point too, and I think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they've lived there and have it all built up, you know, they've got a whole garden and trees and everything so it's not like, we're, uh,  kind of secluded, you know,|sd sd sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours.  You know, right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is.  Like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Of course we got it on, a little bit of more furniture and stuff, but it was just unreal.|sd sd
A|Yeah, like I'm amazed at how much stuff I've accumulated in my apartment,  because, up to this point I was in school so I'd go home every summer|aa sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I could take all my stuff home, because I didn't have a bed or a couch or any, any of that,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
