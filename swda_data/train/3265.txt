B|Huh.|b
A|But, uh, I, with so many options now available, you know, where, where cars are concerned, it just seems like there is, there's almost too much of a choice anymore. You know, there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever. I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into consideration the price naturally. But, um, you know, I would really want something that I would want for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever.|% sv sd sv sv
