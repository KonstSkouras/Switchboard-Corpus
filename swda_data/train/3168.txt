A|Okay. Uh, well, since I initiated the call, I guess I'll start off first. Uh, number one, I have absolutely no problem with random testing. Uh, I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and I feel, I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for, particularly airline pilots and the such. I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now, based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers. So I really don't have a problem with it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Uh, I don't either. I, uh, I've never, I don't work, at home right now. I stay home with my children. Uh, but my husband works and they do have that at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it. We've, particularly, like you said with the things that the airlines and, and such.

A|Yeah, I, well, I happen to be, uh, my job is I'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company, so I, it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause, this type of thing. And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs and we, at the present time, do not have random testing.|aa % sd % sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|And I am pushing towards that. I, I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide, they shouldn't have a problem with it.|sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|And if they are trying to hide something, then I have to know that, because we're we're talking major liabilities. Not only with themselves, but with other employees.|sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I have a real fear, but that at some point something's going to happen. And they're showing it with AIDS, so why, you know, they they ought to start doing something with the drugs So I really have no problem with it.|sd sv sv % sv sd
B|Yeah. Well, it's, it's unfortunate, I think, that everyone doesn't have that opinion. Uh, some people just, uh, I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that, but, uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep talking about the, uh, the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, you know,|aa sv sd sv

B|I, I would think, but, with all the accidents, just with, with, uh, everything happening with, just airlines just drive me crazy. People are afraid to fly now. You know, just because of, they don't know what their pilot's been doing and, and things like that|sv % % sd sv

A|And I think they've had it for several years. And their program they had, I don't think had a lot of, uh, problems associated with it, but, uh, my brother-in-law happens to work there and it, it sounded very positive. And I, I think it's great. I, I would like, I would encourage it. I'm pushing our company towards that. .|sd sd sd sd sv sd sd

A|Right. Exactly.|aa aa
