A|Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are, that are an invasion of your privacy?|qo
B|Well, the, uh, what I really, I don't like is the the constant calls, people selling things people telling me I want things. You know, people trying to solicit for different, you know, organizations.|% sd
A|Oh. Right.|b b
B|You know, that's what I really.|sd
A|Yeah, I think that's, that's the only thing I wrote down also, because that's just a, it's terrible today, I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes.|b sd sv sd
B|Never stops ringing, right. That's right. Well, you know, the, the great, uh, thing for that, it's, uh, is, is an answering machine|^2 % ba sv
A|Yes, I know, that's true.|aa sd sv
B|I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know, you just switch that thing on, and, uh,|sv sd %
A|Yeah, that's true.|aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, you know, people, it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day, and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man|% sv sd
B|Um, even in an office? Uh-huh. Right.|qy^d b b
A|and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also, as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York, and, uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or stock investments  or whatever.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Right, right.|b b b
A|And now I'm getting the same calls at at the house.|sd

A|American Express does that, by the way.|sd
B|Oh, they do?|qy^d
A|Yeah, I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them.|ny sd
B|Well, sure it is.|sv
A|And that is an invasion of privacy, you're right.|sv sv
B|That's right. Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere|aa sv
A|I know, that's true.|aa sv
B|I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever.|sv
A|Exactly, magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing|aa sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's the way they make additional money.|sd
B|That's right.|sv
A|But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh, you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card, so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling.|% sd sv
B|Yeah, that's right.|aa sv
A|So, I don't know. What, what do you, where are you from?|h qw

A|Did you?|bh
B|And that was, uh, California, I was thrilled to death, because that's, you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know, and, um,|sd sd %
A|Yeah, I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York|b sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and I'll get people you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state.|sd sd
B|Oh. Yeah, see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California. I don't know why I ask people on the weekends from out of state, or, uh, I don't know, you know, but,|b b sd sd h %

B|Yeah, so they, Yeah|b % b
A|Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy, but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling.|sv sd
B|Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, and, then, of course they call, you know, before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous|b % b b sv sv
A|I know.|aa
B|you know, I said, this is absurd, I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing.|sd sd
A|That's a, that's a good suggestion. I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings.|sv sd
B|Oh, it's great, I mean. Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard, because I, I always have it on you know,|sv % sd sd
A|Right.|b

B|and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard. You know|sd %
A|Yeah, you're probably right.|b sv
B|Yeah it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know, but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted, and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything, you know, I mean.  Exactly,|b sd sd sd sv
