A|Um, it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically, or in terms of their opinions. But if those who don't vote, if you made them vote and, it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, you know, in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem, um.|sv sv sv

A|I mean, I, I assume that those who don't vote, I mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote, they tend to be, you know, poor blacks, for example, vote very little, and things like that and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter.

I mean, we've just, there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals and you had to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult. And a lot of people revolted against that, they said we don't want to have to decide all these things, you know, that's, that's, that's why we hire people who, uh, you know, to, to make these decisions for us.|% sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd sv

I mean, if if you vote and your guy looses well you you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote, I sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, you know.|% sd sv sv sv

When they especially when someone, they, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for, or something like that. *listen: two utts?

In fact, it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for, up until fairly recently and, that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote. But when you actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its two party system, um, I don't know, I kind of, part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty, um.|sd % sv sv sd sv h % sd sd

A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well that's a thought, or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have, I don't know. The right to write your,|b b ba sv h %

A|Yeah, but technically people, most people, technically it's a privilege, but most people think of it as a right.

A|But I, I also, I also, I don't know if you've, uh, read any of the, um, oh, what do they call those. The, uh, the early republican, uh, republic documents, uh, when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.|qy^d
B|No, no, I haven't.|nn nn sd
A|Um, oh, I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party now,  versus a democratic, uh, government and, arguing successfully, why, the United States should be a republic, not a democracy. Which indeed it really is, a republic, not a democracy.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues. In other words, you vote for representatives.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the whole idea was, um, presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy, Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority. And, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process, because anytime you have a majority, um, they can change the law in a a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case. Um, oh, you know, a if there's some minority that people don't like because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote vote against them.|sd sd sd sd sd % sd

B|I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.|sv
A|Yeah, well their job is to be reelected, by in large, and, so they work on that job.

A|And, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange, because, I mean, if I'm hiring a plumber, I want a real plumber, I want someone trained in,|sv sv %
