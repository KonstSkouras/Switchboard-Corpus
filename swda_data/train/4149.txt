B|Right.|b
A|let me ask you the question, do you have a, uh, budget, or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to?|oo_co_cc qy

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|He helps me out a lot and I get paid monthly, so that's kind of hard to have a budget. My mother, uh, doesn't get paid much money, so her budget is, uh, just, uh, planning for I R A's.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|I see, I see. Well, good, I'm kind of in a different situation, but I, I, I went through that, too, when I was in school, but, uh, I was, I was working to get through college and, and, uh, trying to make it through that, but, uh, I'm married and have, uh, a, a couple of children and we have to, uh, pretty much stick to a budget.|b b ba sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm on a salary so I don't get any overtime or anything like that but, We have a fixed income|sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and we have to make sure that, uh, every dollar we have will, is spent accordingly and, uh, what we try and do to, to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we have the insurance premiums, uh, utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside, and we also try and set aside money for savings, set aside money for the the kids' education college education, the future and, uh, set aside money for bonds|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and we also set aside an emergency fund because we've, uh, we've been married for about ten years|sd sd
B|That sounds good.|ba
A|and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on, there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house, that you have to have money for and, uh, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, uh, you have to have money for.|sd
B|Right. Right.|b b
A|And, uh, then we have, you know, whatever's left over is disposable disposable, yeah, discretionary income, that we use for the rest of the month, so, and it's worked out very well. It's, uh, it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too long on the month and too short on the money and uh, try and stick with that|sd sd sv sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
