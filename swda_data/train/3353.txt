A|Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?|qw
B|Oh, we take little nature hikes and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff. Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, that sounds like fun. I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills|b sv sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and so we used to go camping, my dad would take us, there was, there was four of us kids, we'd, he'd take us, and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids, and it was always fun, uh, because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents, and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing, and hopefully we'd catch our supper, but we never did|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|but it was, it was always fun. We'd always, Mom was always prepared and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything, so we always had, something along to eat, but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows, and it, it was always an enjoyable experience. Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills, I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen, and, uh, there's no hills, it's flat, and then I was in high school, and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing, but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things, but, it, it was always fun. It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, in the hills we, we would do like you you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals, and we always, you know, in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals, but,|sd sd sd %
