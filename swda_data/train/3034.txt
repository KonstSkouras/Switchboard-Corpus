A|You know and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point, and then they kind of fell on their face|qy sd sd

B|Um, I've been really busy at work this past week and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper and, uh, so every day I'll have a newspaper at work, and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper. But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop|sd sd % sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh. Well, that's good. Well, that's interesting. And the topics are interesting, uh, they run a whole gamut of, of, uh, subjects, and, uh, I think we can address every topic, but the depth of knowledge is quite different.|b ba ba sd sd sv sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too. The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.|sv sv sv

A|A love for them.|^2
B|Well, that, not so much that but, uh, even in baseball you can, like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing the ball because I very, I was always very strong and I when I was young I could throw harder, than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.|% ar sv sd % sd
A|Uh-huh. I see.|b ba
B|And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, having trouble.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, and I was a catcher so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff. So I, that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing, so.|sd sd % sd %
A|Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?|qy

A|Oh. Oh, okay.|b bk
B|No, I'd, well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me. But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like, now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,|nn % sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling, but it, as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me then playing football this fall, I, it was just flag football too. I separated it again|sd % sd sd

A|And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport. And, uh, one of the men that was in our on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do. And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage. And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.|sd sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm not sure where all my pins came from, but it's, but that was quite awhile ago but I, and I never pursued it. And a lot of people said, well, you should have turned pro.
