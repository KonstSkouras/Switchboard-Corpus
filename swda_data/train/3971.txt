A|Yeah.|b
B|so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants. I don't, I don't know why. I really got into them. I read, uh, Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography|sd sd sd sd

B|The way he handled that entire situation, there.|^2
A|Yeah, really, you know.|aa aa
B|But, I just think the Giants have a good team. They, they got all, you know, they're, they're, they're real balanced out. They got real good pitching, and they got the hitting to go along with it. So.|sd sd sd sd sd %
A|Yeah, I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.|b sd
B|Yeah, they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, you know. I don't really know what it is, but, but every team that's, that's really good seems, you know, like the A had, they had, they just had it all that one year. So.|b sd sd sd sd %
A|Yeah, um I was mostly an A fan, you know. I had been to more games at the A than I have in the Giants because, uh, I lived in Oakland you know, for some time.|b sd sd
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know|sd
B|Yeah, if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, you know, you  good and the bad|b sv
A|Yeah, right.|b b
B|but. It's, it's kind of hard. I still, basically, the, the, me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere, I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams, but since, me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams, so we, uh|sd sd sd sd % sd %

A|So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?|qw
B|Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say. I haven't really, really, you have to just keep up with everything in the season. It's kind of hard to do, at least, you know,  you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and, and all that,|h % sv sd sd
A|I know.|ba
B|but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.|sv

A|Yeah, well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like.|b sd
B|Yeah, I've heard, I've heard talk about that.|b sd
A|You know, uh, they won't be that far away, but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow.|sd sd
B|Yeah, they're not going to be happy about it.|b sd
A|You know.|qy
B|But I hope they can do good. I mean, that's just, I think they're a good team. That just need that one, one little thing to push them over. I don't know exactly what it is. They got, they're pretty balanced out all the way through. It just might be the drive, you know more than anything else,|sd % sd h % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they just, they probably just need something to push them because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it.|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|Or somebody basically, maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it. Maybe that's what, you know, that's what some teams need. Look at the Twins going from worst to first.|sd sd sd sd
