B|And, uh, then after that I, I went to work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know, then I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church and I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there, he got sick.|sd sd
A|He got sick, yeah.|b^m b
B|Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had, right?|sd ^g
A|Right. Well,|b^m %
B|And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock. Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten. But that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick. And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got, you know. Goes, well, okay, so it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway. Well, you know, what that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office.|sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd qh sd sd sd sd sd
A|yeah.|b
B|And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her and they said, uh, that he's sick. Well she wasn't home.|sd sd sd sd
A|Huh.|%
B|I mean her, all her kids were sick but she wasn't home, right. And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her? No, she didn't do that. So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty. And I had to leave work. It was, it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up. And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything.|sd sd sd qh nn sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Yeah, a little more flexibility. You can come and go.|aa bf bf
B|Yeah, but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care|aa sd
