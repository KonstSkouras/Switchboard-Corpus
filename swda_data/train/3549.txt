A|Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else, but we're going to have, uh, wild boar|sd sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|we, uh, we killed a boar the other day, it was, you know, mating with the sows, and you can't use the piglets, you know, so.|sd sd sd %
B|Huh.|b
A|It's about six months of no use, so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham, and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia|sd sd sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him|sd
B|Is that, is that hard?|qy
A|Well, no, hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap, I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.|nn sd sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah, you just, uh, you kill him, you know, you probably, most guys just shoot them in the head, they go, you know, in a second they're gone|ny % sd % sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use *more than one utt??  and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.|sd
B|Huh. Oh, my goodness.|b ba
A|And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there, and it's the best eating you ever had.|sd sd
B|Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?|qy
A|Yep, just like a pig|ny sd
B|Does it.|bh
A|I mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds|sd
B|Oh my.|ba
A|and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|Well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the and the feet off, and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.|sd sd

B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|I mean, no, I was kidding.|ar sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage, and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs, so it's really, really a tough piece of meat|sd sd sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|So you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days|sd sd
