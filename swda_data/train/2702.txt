B|Clanking ishes oman and children|%
A|Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something, I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door|sd sd
B|What kind of a car do you have now?|qw
A|Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight, and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That same kind of four door, hard top style.|sd
B|You got kids?|qy
A|Uh, no but we're planning for it.|nn sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight but it's in pretty good in really good shape.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that's probably where the first place we'd look.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership|sd
A|That'll do it.|ba
B|Yeah. That'll do it. Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape. I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons,|b sd sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and we've got a minivan,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's great. And I drive, uh, well I used to drive an Escort, but it died on me. So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day.|sv % sd sd sd
A|Oh, geez.|ba
B|And, uh, and this Escort took it all. And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it, and the engine just went.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay.|sd
A|Yeah. Really?|b bh
B|I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it, it it's an eighty-five Aries, but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it.|sd sd
A|Oh, geez.|ba
B|And I just, you know, I just drive it to work. So it's just a ten minute commute every day.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh, I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces.|sd sv
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|But I think, uh, and it's a four door which is nice,|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's still a little cramped. I've got three kids,|sv sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I, I,|%
A|Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.|bf
B|Yeah, that's what, I was thinking of, was a Taurus. Uh,|aa aa sd %
A|Yeah. I, I know a lot of guys at work, they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh, and they still want kind of a sports car. They've been, uh, a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's. That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus?|b sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, really? Yeah|bh ny
A|In fact, it comes with a standard stick and, uh, and a lot of those.|sd sd
B|Ooh.|ba
A|And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that. But, uh,|sd %
B|Yeah.|b
A|and usually they're in like black, and gun metal grey and those kind of colors. You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|They, they put them in sporty colors I guess. But, uh,|sv %
B|Yeah. Well, my wife wants a Miyata.|b sd
A|Oh, well sure That's what, you know, until, until you look at the price tag and then you go, What?|ba % sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?|qh
B|Right, yeah. I know, I know. It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe|b b aa aa sv
A|Yeah. I, I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college. I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my my first job.|b sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But that, that just does not make it as an only car. It's, uh, it's like I, I would, I bought a set of stereo speakers|sv sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it was one of those cash and carry deals. I had to take them one at a time, with the top down. And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down,|sd sd sd
B|Oh, no!|ba
A|and the speaker in the passenger seat.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|And I drove that one home, and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home. And, uh, funny, funniest sight. And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.|sd sd sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, you know, it's funny. Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway.|b b % sv sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last. I never did that. Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|And, uh, because I got a good deal on it|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, that was a great little car. Actually I met, that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never, I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Boy, that's a good deal.|b sv
B|And, uh, in fact I married one of those people|sd
A|Ah, okay. Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again|b sd
B|And it worked. Yeah, it worked all right, real good.|sd b sd
A|Huh. Because I, I know we've, uh, that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission. My, uh, my wife just can't, can't, uh, she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.|b % sd sd sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh, went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive. We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car.|sd sd
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|And we went, uh, we went, uh, we went to a dealership and, uh, it, it was she, she did pretty well. But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot|sd sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking, because that was all it was. It was, it was the funniest thing, it was like, uh, a big Le Baron, it was a Le Baron with everything on it,|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Wow!|ba
A|but it had a standard shift. It was the craziest thing I ever saw.|sd sv
B|That's weird! Yeah.|ba b
A|And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.|sv
B|Huh.|b
A|And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth. She did pretty well after a while.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.|sv
B|Well, my wife, I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, and, in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission. In fact, the minivan's a, has a stick shift.|% sd sd
A|Um, okay.|b
B|And in, this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything. You know, it's got automatic transmission, cruise control, you know, electric locks.|% sd sd
A|Oh, geez.|ba
B|You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know.|sv
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|So, uh,|%
A|Oh, well. Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars|b sd
B|Well, you, um, the, the thing about this, uh, I will say this about the minivan.|% sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.|sv
A|Uh-huh, I would think so, yeah,|aa sv aa
B|It, it,|%
A|because it's so big.|bf
B|Yeah. And, and it was quiet, it had a stereo system.|aa sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|We never had it, you know, we always had the A M radio.|sd sd
A|Sure, sure.|b b
B|And, uh, of course this has, this that had speakers that you can control from the back seat.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And put speaker phones in it. So.|sd %
A|Now, now, now that used to be a luxury, but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory.|sv sv
B|Right.|aa
A|You've got to have that now.|sv
B|That's right. That's right.|aa aa
A|You're used to it and you got to have it.|sv sv
B|And you've got to pay for it too.|sd
A|Yeah. That's true too.|aa aa
B|And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine|sv
A|It, It probably does, it probably does. But, uh,|aa aa %
