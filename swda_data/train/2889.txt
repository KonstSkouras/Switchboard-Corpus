B|Yeah.|b
A|And uh, we, put, we put tung oil on it. Kind of made it sticky for a while. But after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard, and it was all right.|sd sd sd sd
B|I remember it took me a long time, it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer, and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking. Since I've moved away they've had it redone. So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick.|sd sd sd sd sd
