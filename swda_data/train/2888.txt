A|I get my current events basically from news, uh, just because I watch,  pretty much a lot of television, um,|sd
B|Television news? Is it, uh, C N N or HEADLINE NEWS or just local,  news|^2 qy
A|Uh,|b
B|or,|%
A|I watch a little bit of everything. I like to tune into, to C N N because, uh, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on,  everything,   in about five or ten minutes.|sd sd
B|Right. Right.|b b
A|I think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance. Like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.|sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, really quickly,  on regular stations.|sd
B|Well, on commercial radio, I guess, I, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,  or evening on the way to school|% sd
A|Yeah, that's good, too, uh-huh.|b ba b
B|so, So, I don't, uh, I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school,|sd
A|I like K R L D. Uh-huh.|sd b

A|Yeah, where do you go to school?|b qw
B|Uh, University of Texas at Dallas.|sd
A|Oh, Okay. I went to U T at Austin.|bk sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, I'm a news reporter so I, I should get all I can , my news from the from the T V.|sd sd
B|Really.|b
A|But, um,|%
B|I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play,  and listen,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|but, uh,|%
A|I usually don't intentionally. Although I should, I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news. If it comes on, I just happen to hear it. Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to to, in to look at the news. But other,|sd sd sd %
B|Yeah, all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper|b sd
A|Yeah, that's true. That's about it.|aa aa sd
B|That's about it, yeah.|sd %
A|The Sunday paper, it's so full of stuff, but you pick your favorite section, and the rest,  you throw away.|sd sv sv
B|Right. Right.|b b
A|Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it but,|sd %
B|I like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, I don't know, it's variety,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour .|sd
A|Yeah. Is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?|b qy
B|Yeah, it usually is. They throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries. It's kind of like getting a newspaper. There's a lot of sections to it|ny sd sd sv sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|and they, they present different sides of things.|sd
A|Um. Because I find like on K R L D, I like to listen to that, but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.|b sd sd sd
B|Oh, well they spend a little more time, you know, they cover the headlines,|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and,  interviewing people.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, that would probably be better.|b b sd
B|And it's,|%
A|Especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|They have little, little, teeny-weeny news, breaks, you know.|sv
B|Yeah, and only in the morning, I guess, there's a little bit.|b sd
A|Yeah, yeah, basically.|b b sd
B|I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So,|%
A|So let's see, um,|^h
B|And I guess I get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things but,|sd %
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, Right Yeah,|b b b
A|But, um,|%
B|a lot of people are.|sv
A|Yeah, trying to get out of wherever they are but, um, I think, I think news is, I'm wondering where it's going. You know how, I think it will be pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper. I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news. And now, it's, it's kind of your final choice. You watch, first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that.|b sv sv sd % sv sd sv sv sv
B|Yeah, where nobody wants,  to sit down and read.|b sv
A|And I think it, Yeah, yeah.|% b b
B|It's, it takes a lot more time to read something,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you've got news,  bombarding you from everywhere now.|sd
A|So much more effort. Yeah.|sv b
B|You know you,  turn on the T V, turn on the radio.|sd
A|Yeah. But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.|b sv
B|Why is that?|qw
A|I don't, well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio. You still, you have two or three, I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations. And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.|% sv sd sd sd
B|Yeah, I just,|b %
A|And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in,|sv
B|I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is. And I enjoy reading, but most people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and,  flip through the channels, you know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,|sv sd sv
A|True, yeah. True. That's true, too, yeah. Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper.|aa aa aa aa aa ^2
B|Right. And they don't have to go get one, you know.|aa sv
A|One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed in to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it. That's all you have time for.|sv sv
B|Right. Right.|b b
A|Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,|sv
B|Right. Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio because they get on one of these little things,|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they give you headlines that are brief, just, they touch on what's going on. And then they'll get into something and really explore it.|sd % sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|And it's, it's informative. It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear.|sv sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, because that's what we do. I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.|b b sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time. So, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think. I don't know.|sd sv h
B|Yeah, there's so much going on in the world.|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Communication, you know, expands the world now.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|There's too much going on. You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.|sv sv
A|I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news, and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.|sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.|sd
B|And the question is, how much of it or how, some of it, I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing.|qh sv
A|Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|Is it, is it the true story or is it a little bit biased.|qh qrr
A|Yeah. Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they could tell us.|b sv
B|Right.|b
A|So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know. So that, that was pretty scary. But we, I talked to one woman, and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on. And at the same time, I talked to another woman, and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam. And she didn't know what was happening at that time.|qh sd % sd sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|And she was so happy to get the information, you know. So there's just a lot of different opinions on that. But,|sd sd %
B|I, I, you know, I like to, to know what's going on. Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much.|sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News and it will play over and over and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but,|sv sd sv %
A|And then, too, a lot of times I think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.|sv
B|Yeah, they tend to,  dramatize things.|aa sv
A|Like, You know, like this Kennedy thing.|% sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|like a It's just, I mean, everywhere you turn. Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy. You know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night? And you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous.|sv sd sd sd sd sd
