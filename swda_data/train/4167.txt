A|it's, uh, I'll start off here. Uh, I don't know. I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N. Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it, well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule|% oo_co_cc h sd sd sd sv
B|Right, yeah.|b b
A|and, uh, but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,|% sv
B|Yeah. I, I think I'd agree. A, a similar method of getting the news with me too. It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years. Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.|b aa sd sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Right. Yeah. I know, the, my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada. Uh,|b b b % sv %
B|That, that's true, you know. You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.|sd
A|Right. Yeah. I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything and, uh, it's amazing that, you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know, I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.|b b sd sv sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, you know.|%
B|I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>. You just, never see, you just never see anything about it, uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh, and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand. And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S|sd sd sd sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.|sv
A|Yeah, definitely.|aa aa
B|You just don't know what's going on.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'd, I, every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too. You you can tune into some stations|% sd sd sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events. Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>. There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.|sd sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries. I hadn't really thought about it but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.|sv sd sv
A|Right. Exactly. Yeah. I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada. Uh, well part of it, touring. And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on. There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec|aa aa aa sd sd sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I had never heard any of that before.|sd
B|Yeah, you know, there was, a, a, what is it called, is it Meech Lake Accord?|b % qw qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it. And, and came it was a big thing going on there and I came back here and nothing in the papers.|sv sd % sd sd sd
A|Right, right.|b b
B|I didn't see a thing about it. So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess. It's improved. And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news. Even, even there's, uh, uh, it's it's semireligious in some respects. But what is it? It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way, uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel. The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.|sd sv sv sd % sd qw sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh, I, it surprised me. I've caught it a few times and they, they do some pretty good news. Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts. Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.|sd sd sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You'd think it would carry mostly religious but it, it doesn't seem to. So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering. Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries. But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.|sv sv sd sd sv
A|Yeah. Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show. I used to get the, uh,|b sd sd
