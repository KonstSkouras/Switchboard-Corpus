A|I think you got it.|sv
B|Okay. Uh, my first thoughts on capital punishment I, the first thing I want to say is no. Just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd % sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, we are punishing someone for taking someone's life, or, in some cases, we are punishing a person for taking someone's life. And so in effect we are committing that same crime.|sd sd sv
A|Well, it sounds like you have really strong views on it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I can see that point, but I also have this, you know, I, I question. I guess I can look at it both ways. And just to play devil's advocate,  it never seems right to me, that, uh, we take in people that are criminals  and people that are, you know, low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families,|sd sd % sd sv
B|Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people. And it just, that, that I find very difficult to swallow,  sometimes.|sd % sv

A|I'm with you there.|aa
B|Okay. And there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And I'm not saying that, oh, I guess I am kind of saying, what, what are we doing? I mean I guess that's the same thing you were saying. What, what are we doing with these people? They're there, we should either take some kind of action,  or take enough or go a different route.|sd qh sv qh sd sv
A|Right. Exactly.|aa aa

B|Oh, exactly. Uh-huh.|aa b
A|I mean, prison is such a waste of a human being.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It doesn't do anyone any good.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Yes, people need to be punished,|ny sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Um, but, you know,|%
B|But|%
A|but locking someone up and not getting, you know, any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too.|sv
B|Uh-huh. And I guess I see both sides, in that at the, at the same time that I'm saying that, you know, we're committing the same crime,|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I also agree that, I mean, if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases, kill several people at one time. Uh,|sv
A|Uh-huh. Oh, exactly|b %
B|there was a case in Dallas, well, I'm sure they haven't gone to court yet, but, uh, apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell. They put four people in a freezer and shot them all. Now to me, that is inhumane. And for two people to be out in the world like that, I don't, I don't want them in my world.|sd sv sd sd sv sv

A|We want a  safe environment for ourselves. And we want to remove them.|^2 sv
B|Exactly.|aa

B|Uh-huh. Right.|b aa
A|I, I, think, you know, that the whole idea of, uh, the death penalty was invented for two reasons. It removes them from society,|sv sv
B|Right.|aa
A|and, and, you know, you want to appease the people that have suffered.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|But it, it really doesn't take their pain away.|sv
B|Uh-huh. And at, and at the same time, like you said, it drains society.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. But it's a,|b %
B|We, I think we should be, we, the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison, that same money or half of that money could be used towards, uh, rehabilitation programs of some sort. Something to get, to, to put these people back in society,|% sv % sv sv
A|Right.|aa
B|but prepare them first.|sv

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to, you know, have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
A|And these people have not benefited from the stay there. She says, just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there's not anything she can do to keep them in. You know,  if they meet certain guidelines,  you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they can't just walk out of prison and do that. They can't just walk out of prison and say, okay, I'm going to go a different route.|sv sv
A|That's right. That's right.|aa aa
B|There has to be some sort of buffer in there.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Some sort of program or, and I know this costs money, but it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending.|sv sd sv
A|I know, I know. I, I would like to see the money that's been budgeted, budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of, of alternate solutions to the problem.|ba ba sv
