A|Okay. Do you work?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
B|Yes, I do.|ny ng
A|I think that's the main change. What do you think?|sv qo
B|Well, I think that's a big part of it and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and,  I almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.|sv sv sv
A|Right. That's right.|aa aa
B|But, but yeah, I think that's a big change I'd like to not work. What about you?|sv sd qo
A|Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I just, physically I wasn't able to and I mean, I love my job.|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I have four children, and that's real hard. You have children? I assume so.|sd sd qy^d qy^d
B|Yes. I have two and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman,|ny sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|but as long as I you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could,  as well as I could et cetera.|sd

B|And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids. Well, I have two. I have a four year old and a three year old.|sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b

B|You do there's of course, you know, everything you give up something but I just, I, the kids are so wonderful|% sv % % sd
A|Yeah. .|b %
B|But I do think that's one of the major changes. You know, my mama I remember her being home uh,  you know, she made breakfast in the morning for us.|sv sd
A|Yep. Fine . Yep. I know.|b fo_o_fw_"_by_bc aa sd
B|And if she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school, and she was there when we got home.|sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm home when they are home. In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store, and I'm just really hesitating,  because I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever,  so like seventeen years with my kids.|sd sd sd

A|Of course, their, their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine|sd
B|Oh. Oh.|b b
A|and we are just running every direction and,|sd %
B|But see, it's such an important time to be home. You know.|sv
A|It is.|aa
B|And that,  was important to me enough,|sd
A|It is.|aa
B|you know, my husband was raised, uh, his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,|sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over. In fact, everyday,  I've got boys hanging around, and it's wonderful I'm real close to the schools and, you know, we are just I, I'm very happy to be staying home.|sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|But again I miss,  the .|sd
B|So, where do you see,  us changing in the future?|qw
A|I don't.|sd
B|Well, see that was one of the things the, the question I think is,  you know, what changes do we see|sd
A|I keep on working . Right.|sd fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere. I think they are still going to have to work.|sd sv
A|That we are because it's so expensive. If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,|bf bf
B|Right.|aa
A|The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then there is the gas,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then there is the lunches and then the day care.|sd
B|The day care eats,   me alive.|sd

B|You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty,  a month  for two kids|sd
A|Oh  my gosh. Yeah, for two.|ba b b^m
B|They would eat you,  alive.|sv
A|It's almost hardly worth it for you,  to work until they get in school.|sv
B|I know.|aa
A|Then you work summers unless you are a teacher. Are you a teacher?|sd qy
B|No, I'm not, and I would love, you, you, you talked about having the summers off and I thought, oh, that would be so wonderful. And I love the little preschool they are in. It's wonderful.|nn ng sd sd sd sd sd
