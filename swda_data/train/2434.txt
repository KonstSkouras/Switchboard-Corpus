B|Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?|qw
A|Well, I don't know. I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening. Uh, I'm against it but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that So I, I have a rifle in the house. Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it. But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon. Uh, how do you feel about it?|h sd sd sd sd sd sd qo
B|Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.|sv
A|Huh.|%
B|And, I think they need that. Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol. It's a little twenty-two and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.|sv sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you know, I do like to have my guns. Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know. And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I like to have them where handy.|sd
A|Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition. And I thought that was really good. And I think if they, uh, takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition. You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.|sd sv sv sd sd
B|I've never heard of anything like that.|sd
A|Yeah. Uh,|b
B|That would be nice. But,  you know, the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.|sv % sv
A|I  I, I agree. I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it. But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.|aa sv sv
B|Yeah|b
A|And you can get them really cheap.|sv
B|I know I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we bought it there. And,|sd %
A|How long was the waiting period out there?|qw
B|About nine days.|sd
A|Huh. That wasn't too, too bad.|% sv
B|No. No|aa aa
A|Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it. You're not going to react that quickly. In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.|sv sv sv
B|somebody wants to do that, I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.|sv sv
A|Yeah. I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose. They both do the same kind of job.|aa sv sd
B|A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.|sv
A|Uh, yeah. I suppose. I never got shot with either one. But I don't know, uh, I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun|aap_am aap_am sd h sv
B|No, a shotgun's got too much of a spread. Or at  least ours does.|aa sv sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, it's, you know, you have a little, uh, thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you, you turn it,|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And the spread changes.|sd
A|Uh, I've got a manual single shot and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it. The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets from the target.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets. It's got a hell of a kick to it.|sd sd
B|Yeah. My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time. And I shot that thing one time. Almost knocked me down. And it just a I I forget, I think it was a three fifty-seven. I'm not sure.|b sd sd sd % sd sv h
A|Do you belong to a gun club or you?|qy
B|He belonged to one awhile back. Uh, since we moved, we've only been here in Texas for about a year|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for  target practice.|sd
A|No kidding.|ba
B|I'd love to get used to that shotgun. We traded his pistol for that shotgun.|sd sd
A|Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but, uh, it's well worth it. You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition. Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire. Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high. Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member. So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club. Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.|sd sv sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Well, that's what my husband, when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it's a cough or something was It, you know, he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.|b sd sd % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.|sd
A|I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose. In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.|sv sv
B|That's a good, I've never thought of that. That's a good point.|ba sd ba
A|And, you know, it, it, even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive. And you give him a license because he waited nine days.|% sv sd
B|Yeah. That's, and, yeah.|b % %
A|He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself. He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.|sv sv

A|Wow.|ba
B|I can't remember what the the term was going around. It was about four or five years ago. But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea|sd sd sv
A|About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons? Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me. How do you feel about that? Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller? And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh, because you own it?|bf sd qo qy qrr
B|Uh, that's a hard one because we did that. But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it. I'll, uh, you know, the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.|h sd % sv
