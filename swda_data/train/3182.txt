A|How did you ever get into that? That sounds so interesting.|qw sv
B|My husband kept begging me, and he's been dead now for twenty years, so you understand that this was a long time ago. But he finally brought me the china, the book, the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons.|sd sd sd sd
A|How I,|ba %
B|And I said I'll do it for three months and if I don't like it, that's it. Well, I painted an awful lot until his death, which was several years. And it has just been the most relaxing, enjoyable self-satisfying thing I've had. I,|sd sd sd sd %

A|We've transferred around, and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake, uh, on Lake Erie. So the lake life appealed to me, and my husband's working and he left it up to me if I worked or not.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|So, in my spare time, I love to sew. There aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing, but I do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home, so I enjoy doing my, uh, toppers for my window applications and things like that.|sd sd sd sd sd

B|What part of Ohio are you in?|qw
A|We're in the I'm in the suburb of Cleveland and I'm about, uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown Cleveland, something like that.

B|Oh, what's that,|%

A|Oh, how marvelous.|ba
B|Then, then we had so much fun there, I had a friend from Albany, which is about thirty-six miles away, and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home, because she did our firing for us, and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her, supplies and it was just such a delightful time.

B|I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death. So I have put it aside for a little while, but I'm, I have just found me an instructor to get started again, uh-huh.|sd sd sd b
