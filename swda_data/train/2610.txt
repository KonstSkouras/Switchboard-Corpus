A|So, how do you feel about the metric system?|qo
B|Oh, I like it. I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile. And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters, I was trying to build a shed and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ...|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah, and it's, I forget how many millimeters. So you used the metric?|b % sd qy
B|Well, no. What we did was wind up using, and you just go, you just go down and, and you get out the, the, so many inches and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters, you could have done. I think what's interesting, the way engineering people do is they, they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches.|nn sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd
A|Uh, yeah, yeah.|b b
B|Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?|qy
A|Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, I work in metal fab and tenths of inches are, are normal. And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch.|ny ny sd sd sd

A|Yes, I am. I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me. But my ...|ny sd sd sd sd %

A|Right.|b
B|Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch. But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate.|sv sv sd
A|Yeah, yeah, yeah. To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ...|aa aa aa sv
B|Yeah. and, and you've got to go over there and try it and I suppose, you know, I need a larger one. I need a smaller one. I mean obviously you can look at it and say well, anyway. I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't, I don't know, do you, do you drink adult beverages?|aa sv sv ^q sv sv h qy

B|Yeah.|b
A|And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.|sd
B|Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field, for why, why, why pieces, could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't.|qy % qy

A|And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator and on the water pump, it was all metric. And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator hose clamps.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Essentially they do that though because if, if you look at General Motors, the size and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler. If they all went, if they all went metric, but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something, uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,|b b b sv sv sv % sv
