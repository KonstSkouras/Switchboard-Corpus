A|So, do you have any credit cards?|qy
B|Yes, I do. I keep, uh, I have an American Express, and a Visa card that I keep, you know, kind of for emergency purposes, and I have, you know, I use a gasoline credit card which I, you know, pay off every, every month.|ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Okay.|b b
B|But I've, I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, you know, that I possibly could, and my balances are practically zero on the ones that I have. Especially since, you know, it's no longer after this year, or after tax year nineteen ninety, there's no deductions for, you know, credit card interest that you pay.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's a, you know, gosh, credit cards run, what, anywhere from, up to eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess.|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's just a bad deal. Course, there are emergencies, you know, that you, you know, probably need to have a card.|sv sv
A|Yeah, I have one card.|aa sd
B|Uh-huh, that's, that's probably enough.|b sv
A|And I try not to use it, but right now, it's maxed out|sd sd
B|Absolutely. It's, it's very easy to, you know, to do that or, you know, to abuse it, it really is.|aa sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's so easy to pull out the plastic, but we're trying our best not to, not to add any, you know, credit card debt to our structure here.|sv sd
A|Yeah. Um, I have, uh, the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards, I think, is, uh, you mentioned the gasoline credit card.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't have that, but I've got, you know, one of the the, the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And we use that usually to buy gasoline, and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I'm sure you're right. I don't, I don't, I don't participate in that, but, you know, a lot of folks do.|b aa sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah, at least with the, uh, gasoline company credit cards you have, you know, up to thirty, twenty-five, thirty days, you know, interest free for it.|b sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, you know, the instant thing may be, may, may be the way of the future to, you know, to replace checks and every other thing.|sv
A|Yeah, that's what they've, they've talked about it.|aa sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Course it eliminates any waiting period.|sd
B|It certainly does.|aa
A|God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that.|sd
B|Absolutely. That's right. Do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that?|aa aa qy
A|No.|nn
B|I see.|bk
A|Oh, it was, well, they consider it to be the same as cash well, cause it actually is.|% sd
B|I see, I see. It certainly is, yeah.|bk bk aa aa
A|Yeah. It's better than cash|b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They don't even have to deposit it, it just goes straight in there.|sd sd
B|That's right. No returned checks or anything.|aa bf
A|Right.|aa
B|Yeah. No, I, I understand it's becoming, you know, the popular thing to do. We're not participating in that particular program at the moment, and I don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to.|b fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|But, uh, I have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards. It's just, you know, too easy to do.|sd sv
A|Yeah, but I'm so glad he told me that when, that they, they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them.|aa sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|They paid them off, and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them. She said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out. I mean, that's funny.|sd sd sd sv
B|Well, that's a novel idea. Yeah, that would cause you think a little while, wouldn't it. That may not be a bad idea. But I'm kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards, you know, as time goes by. Unless you just absolutely have to. Now, there are times when you'd at least think you do, anyway.|sv % qh sv sd sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah. I, I want to still have just one just in case.|b b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I'd sure want to get the, get it paid down and not use it for a while|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. That's right. My wife and I really, I guess are fortunate. We're really not compulsive shoppers, you know.|b b aa sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We, we plan purchases, you know, pretty well, you know, watch for the best buys, things like that. But, uh, some people have a real problem with it.|sd sd
A|Yeah. Well, our, our limit is, you know, fairly low|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, so that's, that's one thing that's good.|sd
B|Sure. Absolutely. Yeah.|aa aa aa
A|Oh, I've got another call.|sd
