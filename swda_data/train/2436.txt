B|Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated.|sd
A|Well, I can understand that. It's that time of the year.|ba sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We just, my wife and I just recently moved into our house. So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But. Um, like to keep up to date too.|sd sd
B|Oh. Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|I guess, in the, since I got out of college, which was about five years ago, my T V viewing started to tend more towards, uh, documentary, news programs, things like that.|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Something that's going to keep mu up to date. I've kind of, kind of gotten away from, uh, being a series watcher, having to keep up to date with, uh,|sd sd
B|Oh, yeah. I think when you're in college you kind of, you have more of a regular schedule in terms of, you can watch every week.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, that makes a big difference.|b aa sv
B|So, yeah, I, I used to, when my kids were real little and I was home, I watched, where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis. But right now, the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out.|aa % sd sd sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Did you all ever watch that?|qy
A|I, yeah, I started, too, and, uh kind of, kind of worked away from that.|na
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|I, I have a hard time sticking with something like, like on T V, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You feel kind of left out|sv
B|Right, right.|aa aa
A|But, um, right.|b^m
B|I know, but I tell you what, um, we're really strict with our kids about television, and one night, couple weeks ago, it was just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch, and we said okay, well we'll sit down and we'll, you know, look at what you want to see. Let's just turn it on and see what's on. We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it.|aa ^h sd sd sd sd ^q ^q sd
A|I believe that.|ba
B|So, you know, it was prime time, it was, what, seven thirty, eight o'clock on a week night|sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|and we have cable, and there wasn't anything on any channel, and the stuff that was on the prime, the networks, you know, A B C, N B C, C B S, was, it was just, um, dribble|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, I mean, it wasn't even funny|sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|it wasn't creative, it, it was the worst I've seen. I mean, I have not watched prime time, week night T V, I guess in a real long time because I was shocked.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah. I know exactly how you feel.|b ba
B|You know what I'm saying.|qh
A|That's right. I, uh, when I first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable, and I guess I sort of, kind of became numb.|aa sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know. And then all of a sudden, I started paying, paying attention to soft voices in the network T V again, once in a while.|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Right now we don't have cable.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And it's surprising how much it's changed|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different. And we don't have any kids yet, but I feel the same way. It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids. Even, even cartoons, um|sv sd sd sv
B|Right. Oh.|b b
A|you know, you watch some of the cartoons, and kids aren't, aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's, none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.|% sv
B|Right, it's just, it's just, uh, like a necessary evil. I mean, when we, when our children were younger, when they were like four years old, three years old, five years old, we just had Sesame Street and that was about it, you know.|aa sv sd sd
A|Right, right.|b b
B|But now, in order to seem, you know, humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.|sv
A|Oh, yeah, yeah.|aa aa
B|But it's, just one of those things, you know, you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room. So, But it's such a shame, because it could be so good.|sv sv sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|I don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it. Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff.|sv
A|Well, that's true.|aa
B|It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that. That can't be the problem.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It must be the marketing pressures, and, you know, their demographic studies that they do that show, you know, that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something.|sv sv
A|I'm glad you said it and I didn't have to. But that, that, that's the, I feel the exact same way. I sit, I sit and watch some shows, and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show.|sd sd % sd sd sd
B|I know.|ba
A|You know, why do you do this to yourself?|qh
B|Why do you do this?|qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I know, I'm trying to think if there's anything I do, you, like, uh, I like stuff that's on Great Performances, and, I, we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that.|aa sd sd sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|As a matter of fact, you know when I was a kid, excuse me, my parents used to have, we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched, we had to watch an hour of public T V|sd sd
A|Now there's an idea.|ba
B|That was just the rule. And if they saw us watching the, something, they'd say, all right, what did you see on WHAT'S NEW, or there was some other, the children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Okay, yeah.|b b
B|So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.|sd
A|Yeah, yeah. That's pretty good.|b b ba
B|Do you, do you watch sports on T V? Are you a sports fan?|qy qy
A|I can't handle it very long.|no
B|Yeah|b
A|I, I mean, I'm, I'm a sports fan, but it's, well, it's kind of, it's kind of like reading magazines any more. If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.|na sv sv
B|Right, yeah.|b b
A|But, uh, it, it's, you're missing an awful lot.|% sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'd rather, personally rather watch, see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium. but uh,|sd %
B|Yeah, that's true, the traffic.|b aa %
A|But, uh, no,|nn
B|Uh.|b
A|I don't sit down, I'll sit down for the big games, the Super Bowl, and the championship you know, things like that.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I don't follow any team.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I check the scores the next morning, and I know how everybody's doing, and that suffices me. But, I like, I like good comedy, good humor once in a while.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, I, I enjoy that, but what do you, where do you do you get that You don't have cable now, I was going to say they have a comedy channel now. But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly, uh, commercials, and then you're, you know, trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up. You know what I did. There was a time there where I could tape things and then I'd fast forward through the commercials.|b b sd qw qy^d sd sv sv qh sd sd

A|Yeah, it works, you bet, yeah.|aa aa ba aa
