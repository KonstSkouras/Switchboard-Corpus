And then they, they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific. And, I loved them both. I really do. I think they're wonderful. That's our favorite. You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's. Have you been there?|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd qy
A|No, um, but I've heard that's really good, too, and,|nn sd %

A|Oh.|b
B|So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in. And, as long as you know that it's okay. But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib um, anywhere in the area.|sd sd sd
A|Oh. Oh, okay.|b bk
B|I love it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, my husband really likes their ribs. So it's hysterical. We go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu .|sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|Really? Really?|bh bh
A|and, uh, the, my husband and I like veal, uh  a lot|% sd

A|Right. And,|b %
B|And, uh, I've, I've not been there.|sd

B|I've been there.|sd
A|Oh, I, we just|%
B|That was nice|sd
A|It was and we had the, uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did. It was wonderful but, uh, and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert  which was a chocolate sack. I don't know if you tried but  or|aa sd sd sd sd sd qy^d %
B|Oh I've heard of it. Where, where it's made, it's like, it's like a, it's all chocolate, like made like a paper bag|% sd sd % sd

B|Oh.|b
A|and, and we shared one, the three of us|sd

B|Oh.|b
A|It was beautiful|sd
B|Oh, I bet it was. I bet it was.|ba ba
A|Uh|%
B|The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day, and we took another friend with us|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and, uh, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves And so we had, they had, uh, like a berry assortment. It was, it was raspberries and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.|sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the, you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it|sd sd
A|Yes. Yeah Oh.|b b b
B|and it was outstanding.|sd
A|It sounds wonderful.|ba
B|It was really, really relatively simple but, oh, it was good. It was really good.|sd sd sd
A|Well, that's, uh, one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant. Uh, I love fresh berries. And, their, their fruits are always exceptional. I don't, I'm, know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,  you can't find them like that|sd sd sd sd sd
B|You can't find them. Yeah.|^2 b
A|and,|%
B|Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I'm originally from Connecticut and, uh, I was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and, uh, I was really amazed, you know, the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint. You know, they were real, real pretty but they lacked, the service and they lacked the the, just the, I don't know. The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh, I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.|b b b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I thought I would really miss that.|sd
A|I would, too, because, well, because we don't go out very often. When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess, and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience. Of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh too.|aa sd sd sd sv sv
B|Uh-huh. And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.|sd
A|Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful. It's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell. They have the most wonderful salads. They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
