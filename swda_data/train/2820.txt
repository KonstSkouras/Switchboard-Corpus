A|Okay. Uh, I really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing. But, uh, just off the top of my head, I, I don't think I see much wrong with it. Um, if I owned a company and I wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that I had, uh, coming in, uh, were trust worthy, et cetera, and so on, I think I would, I would, uh, probably do the random testing just to insure that my company, uh, runs safely and smoothly.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd sv sv
B|Yeah. Um, I, I also haven't thought too much about it. Uh, but I suspect it, it very much depends upon the job.|b sd sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Maybe. There are some jobs where I guess it doesn't really,|aap_am sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's, it's, it's, if it's not affecting someone's performance then I'm not sure if it's a problem.  If, if, if,|sv
A|Yeah. That's true I didn't think about that, like for instance,  Uh, if someone's working on heavy machinery,  or say driving trucks or buses, city buses or something like that.|b aa sd sv
B|Right.|aa
A|Then that is something that affects the, that affects the community. You know, if you're, you're drinking or on drugs or whatever, you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands.|sv sv
B|Right. And then if you're a computer operator and, uh, there's really no big deal, I think, you know,  that maybe it's not necessary.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah. And for me, I think that drug testing, it follows the path that society is going in. If more and more people are using drugs then I think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs.|b sv sv
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|I mean, it's just, it's just where society is right now, and you know, something we have to cope with and I think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah. Well, I think it may, it may, that's in, in that respect, I think it may help a lot. I think it may be pushing people, hopefully push people away from drug use, If they no that, you know. *spelling:know|b sv sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, I think that may be.|b aa aap_am
B|If you use drugs, you won't get the job.|sd
A|That means one of the points of it. Of course I think, um, I'm not sure, you know, what the time span is, but, I mean, if I used drugs last week and I had a, you know, job interview that I wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it. You know, what I'm saying?|sd h sd sd qy
B|I don't know,|sd
A|They may not be able to trace it. I don't know how far they trace. I don't know what the, you know, limits are.|sd sd sd
B|I don't know that would actually be an interesting thing to find out, I think. I don't, I don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood, in the system. I've heard some, I've heard some things will stay there for six months, some stay for less, some stay for longer.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah. Oh, really. *bh|b
B|Things like L S D, I guess, stay forever. In some ways, you get flashbacks for, uh, forever. I, I, I guess so.|sd h sd no
A|Something like that, yeah.|aap_am aa
B|I mean, there must be some, some, something, I mean, people get these little flashback things, you know,  of some sort,|sd sd
A|Um.  Yeah.|b
B|so I don't really know.|sd
A|I mean, I don't use any drugs. I don't really drink or anything, so I'm pretty, uh, uh, I guess, decisive about that, just the fact that since I don't use drugs, I have no problem with taking a test.|sd sd sd sd
B|Right. Well, see, if you actually used drugs at all,|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I'm, I'm at, at most a social drinker,|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|so it's never a problem.|sd
A|So the only thing I would hate is if I were to go and, uh, I mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test. If you don't have anything to hide, you're not going to mind it.|sd sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|And then there are some things that just aren't peoples business,  that come out at that point|sv
B|Right. That, that, that,|aa %
A|so I think that a lot of people have trouble with that.|sv
B|But,  that's a fine line to draw.|sv
A|I can, I can understand that. Huh-uh. Huh-uh.|sd b b
B|I mean, uh, that's really do you, uh,  do you worry about, you know, this or that,|% qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, you know, what about the rights,  to privacy,|qh
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|what if they're doing something legal, but they would rather have it private,  you know.|qh sv
A|Right. Right.|aa aa
B|Like, especially in the case of drinking. You know, if someone is something more than a social drinker, shall we say, yet, they're not an alcoholic, what do you do?|sv qh
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|So.|%
A|I mean, I took a lie detector once and I didn't mind it, but I was just offended by some of the questions, I guess. I mean, there was one question, do you like your mother? You know? I said, yes. Do you hate your mother? No. Have you ever killed your mother? And I was going, you know, What in the world.|sd sd sd sd qy sd ^q ^q ^q sd
B|Well, those are just, yeah, Those are just to get, probably to get some sort of, those are to get the shock value out of you.  Shock.|ba b sv
A|Is that what it was?|qy
B|I do some, I'm a graduate student in Psych.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|And we sort of, you know, figure out, um, I know a little bit about that kind of stuff.|sd sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|What they're trying to do there is, they want to sort of get a base line measure for you, you know. How is it that when you see these things and, you know,  and, and, and,|sd sd
A|Huh-uh. Kind of get,  Kind of get something to measure my responses by.|b sd
B|Yeah. But with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping,  around and being fidgety,|b sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|Maybe . It can be shocking and,  shock you.|aap_am sv sv
A|Yeah they ask why I was going, what in the world are you asking me about here. But I guess, I don't know, some people have probably killed their mothers.|aa sd ^q
B|Yeah.|ny
A|I don't know|h
B|Yeah, well, I guess so, I mean, I guess, I don't know how, what actually happens if, uh, if you have killed your mother|aa h h
A|Yeah|b
B|Big jump there. But, yeah,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think it's their way of saying how well you do,  in a shock situation without worrying about,  stuff like that.|sv
A|Huh-uh.  I never thought about that, that makes me feel a little better Of course, that was years and years ago.|b ba sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, and I don't think that you killed your mother though, I wouldn't worry about that.|b b sd sv
A|because in society a lot of people are taking drugs. There is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives. But they take a lie detector test or a drug test, or whatever and the stuff that happened to them, you know, five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better. You know, when they might be actually trying to,  improve their lives.|sv sv sv sv sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah. That's, uh, you know, it, it could blow things right away for them, you know.|b b sv
A|Huh-uh. Huh-uh.|b
B|Unless they say, well, look, unless they walk in, they could walk in and say, look, I did do drugs a year ago, and I'm off them for a year now. I'll be happy to take the test, but it will show up positive.|sv ^q ^q ^q
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|versus,|%
A|I would probably do that. And I would probably bring something in showing that I had been to such and such hospital for help or, you know,  Whatever the twelve month program.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Or whatever it is that they do.|sd
B|Yeah. Because, I mean then, although then, they can't legally discriminate, I think on the basis .|b sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|But I don't really know. I don't know what the laws are pertaining to this.|sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|My wife probably does.|sd
A|I'm not sure what they are either.|sd
B|I don't, I don't .|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, it's an interesting topic that I never actually thought about .|sd
A|Yeah. The other day we had talked about, uh, capital punishment.|b sd
B|Oh, I .|b
A|And I really, really hadn't thought about it. I mean, I think about it because I hear about it, but I hadn't had to sit down and, and well, what do I think about it You know, and that's kind of like today. I'm not real sure what I think about it. I'm kind of, you know, in the middle on that one.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Well, these are tough. I sort of like that stuff, it makes you think.|aa bf sd sv
