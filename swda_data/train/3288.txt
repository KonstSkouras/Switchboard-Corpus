A|Hi. So, uh, what was the last car repair you had?|fp qw
B|Just recently I was kind of laughing when I, when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, I had to have my, uh, radiator flushed|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|and it was getting rusty. And the thing that they forgot to do was to, um, to also look at the hose, and I had gone about oh, two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst. So I was stranded out on the highway|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, no. Did you crack the block or what?|ba qy
B|No, I, I didn't do that thank goodness, but, uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that but it cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it. So that was, that was a horrible experience just recently.|nn sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah, I see. You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.|bk bk sv
B|Yes, yes.|aa aa
A|That can be pretty serious.|sv
B|I know. I know. What about you?|aa aa qo
A|Oh, I guess it's been awhile for me. I'd it's been about a year.|sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, I had the, uh, the water pump break on my car.|b sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|Yeah, I was traveling, uh, I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it broke like in the middle of nowhere.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I had to get it towed and then fixed and|sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|big pain.|sv
B|Oh, oh, I know. I know. Especially when you're out on the highway.|aa sv
A|Yeah, that's where I was. Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride.|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I know, well, you know, uh, living in Dallas, you know we've got, uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and, uh, that was, that was horrible.|b b sd sv sd
A|Yeah|b
B|You know to have the, you know, your car is fuming and everything. It's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too. Oh, shoot But my car is getting old. See it's about six years old now, so.|% sd sd sd sd ba sd sd %
A|Yeah, so is mine|b sd
B|Yeah, so I got it right out of college and so it's, uh, it's starting to show the wear and tear now.|b sd sd
A|Yeah, I'm hoping mine gets me through. I got until May until I'm out. So when I cross that one I'll be okay.|b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, that, uh, that was my graduation present to myself, so.|b b b sd %
A|Oh, that's nice|ba
B|Yeah. Yeah, I know so but gosh, it's really starting to, to wear so I've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car.|aa aa aa sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|because I can't, uh, I don't know if I want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown.|sd
A|Yeah, I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is and it's not worth it|aa sd sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, that's true. I agree with you there.|aa aa aa aa aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I don't know, uh, because I, I need to have it tuned, you know, tuned up and I don't know, replace some of the belts. And I was looking at the, uh, tires need to be replaced and so I was thinking just a lot of money I'm, might as well buy me a new car for that.|h sd sd sd sd % sd
A|Yeah, I got new tires last winter too so I'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing. It's not worth it.|aa sd sd ^q
B|Uh-huh. Well, you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy, you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?|aa qy^d qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Uh-huh|b
A|Yeah, we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.|ny sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh, okay. So,|bk %
A|Lot of snow and a lot of cold.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground?|b qy
A|Yeah, at times there's a lot of it.|ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance.|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah, well, rust and the, and the body too, huh?|b b qy
A|Yeah, I haven't had a big problem with that though.|ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So I've been pretty lucky there.|sd
B|Well, I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can, um,|sd
A|Yeah, that's usually pretty good. You just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it.|aa ba sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, and go like that so.|b aa %
A|Yeah. I usually like to do most repairs on my own though.|b sd
B|Do you?|bh
A|Yeah, just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't.|ny sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|Yeah. Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.|b sd
B|Well, I, I think I'm getting too old for all that. My, uh, I had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff so I can, I can do all that stuff but I, I think I'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to, to go have it done now so I can get my hands dirty. So, yeah. I'm just getting, getting to that age I guess. You just don't have, your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore|sd sd sd sd sd sd b sd % sd sd
A|More fun things to do.|bf
B|Absolutely, absolutely. So, yeah, I'm trying to, you know, I just need one, I had two cars there for a while so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run.|aa % sd sd sd sd
A|Well, that's nice.|ba
B|And yeah, so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them.|aa sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And yeah, so that,|b^m %
A|One is bad enough|sv
B|Yes, one was bad enough. But I think I got rid of the wrong one I soon, I need a lot of repairs done on, on this one so yeah, that was, uh, that was something else Well, are our five minutes up?|aa aa sd sd % sd fc

So, but I guess they were talking about experiences. You know, I, uh, uh, I did, my parents live in Ohio so I, I do know something about the, you know, the really cold weather.
