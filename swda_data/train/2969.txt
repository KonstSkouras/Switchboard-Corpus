A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Ooh.|%
A|I know, we are about to hit it in ten, few minutes. I figured I could make this call and get it over with. We are going to mow and trim and edge,|aa sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that is all we have been doing all weekend.|sd
B|You know what? It seems like we are doing it here forever. We bought a, a large house that was completely unlandscaped. I mean, it, it was probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles. That was all that was there.|qh sv sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we hired a professional landscaper to do it. And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time. And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year, probably through the Fall too. And, uh, rip up, rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires, uh, more care than I am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh, how many kids do you have?|b qw
B|Just two,|sd

A|If I can just nuke it, I would do it. But I do not. I just, it is like, oh, I will get out there and pull my weeds. I do not have a real big front yard. But I do have half of it is a flower bed, just about, all by the porch.|sd sd % sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Because the porch is pretty big, I live in town. But just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts. I do not like it. And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff. And I just plowed through the whole nine yards. Got up everything. There was some plants that are just Spring bloomers|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Have you had, is this the first year they have been up?|% qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, let me tell you, they do not come back very well at all. Maybe they will if, up further north. But down, and you are not that much further north. I have probably planted oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.|sv sd % sd sd
A|Of hyacinths?|br
B|No, I have probably have done hyacinths.|nn sd
A|Oh, of everything.|bf
B|But I have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming. Because they do not take the heat here. And if they do come back next year, they are going to look real puny.|sd sv
A|Oh, they will?|qy^d
B|Yep.|ny
A|Huh.|%
B|About the only bloom, bulb that repeats well in my area is the, uh, uh, daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb.|sv

B|You know what I bet you they are? And I am a pretty, I am a pretty good gardener because I have killed a lot of things here and, and I have planted a lot of them. And, and I work on a, uh, landscape committee for our neighborhood.|bh sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And our neighborhood is a planned development with, I think, it is seven hundred and fifty-five families.|sd

A|Yeah. It is some type of lily.|aa sv
B|And I will get, uh, is it, what color is, is yours blooming?|sd % qw
A|I have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue. Which I would not, would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better. And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color. With little purple spots that it, it will fade into a solid purple.|sd
B|And what does the foliage look like? Does it fit that,|qw qy
A|Green spiky leaves. Now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a, a lot higher.|sd sd

A|I would took, I took and just mowed over them last year.|sd

B|Yep.|b
A|Well, I went out there this Spring, and they had took root right where they were, on top of each other. And they told me that they are the hardest things to, you know, to kill.|sd sd sd

A|Well, that is,|%
B|But it has been about three or four years of, uh, uh, playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here.|sd
A|Well, what kind of blue? I am wanting I want blue and purple and, you know, just different shades of that. Because my, my house is gray,|qw sd
B|You want blue?|qy

B|Yep. Well, the, you know, nursery men will will sell you things here. And they are, they are kind of in a labor of love. The other thing to do if you, really like the hyacinths, and I do, is that before you plant those bulbs, stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them.|b sd sd ad
A|Yeah. That is what I did with my plants. I had bought these, uh, colossians Celosias or whatever.|b sd sd
