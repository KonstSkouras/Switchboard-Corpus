A|Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?|qy
B|Yeah, our budgeting plan includes me getting a job We're, we're at the point now, I I quit working about six months ago to start this house|ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I'm out of cash and I'm not out of project yet.|sd sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work. As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate. Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes. So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then. But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know, we always put ten percent back, and that's a never touch.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh, into savings.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Oh.|b
B|Either savings or investment, one of the two, but we don't ever put it in a high risk. It's just always going to be there.|sd sd sd
A|Well, that's pretty good.|ba
B|And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know, we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food|sv sd
A|Boy, that's pretty good.|ba
B|and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house. And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate. I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that,|sd sv sd
A|Sure.|b
B|but, uh, we're still making the payments on them. It's just, when you, see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home  and do it yourself.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, it's, it's tough here too. You have to have the contractor sign with you.|b sd sd
B|Right, exactly.|aa aa
A|But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|, where I live, that is.|sd
B|And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the bank can eat the contractor.|sd
A|Oh, bad for him, huh.|bf
B|Yeah, bad for him. But, the homeowner can't be touched.|aa sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|It's a homestead state.|sd
A|Is that right?|qy
B|Yeah, see right now if I quit paying any of my bills, the only thing they could do is cut off electricity. They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.|ny sd sd sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything that's not the tools of your trade, but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.|sd sd sv
A|Well, that's kind of handy.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Pretty interesting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Texas has quite the history.|sv
B|Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know We just going to spend it all.|sd sd
A|That's kind of what we do. We, uh, we're L D S and so we pay ten percent tithing|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, and my wife doesn't work. We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.|sd sv
B|Yeah, yeah, we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt. You know, uh, we paid cash for car. Well, we bought the car on time, one of them, but we, you know, we since paid it off.|b b sv sd sd sd
A|Well that's pretty.|ba
B|The land is paid for cash, so we don't have to worry about that.|sd sd
A|That's a great position to be in.|ba
B|Well, it's fraught with other problems|sd
A|Is that right?|qy
B|Yeah, I'm not very motivated|ny sd
A|Oh What kind of consulting do you do?|b qw
B|Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.|sd
