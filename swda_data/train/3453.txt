A|Okay, did they tell you our topic?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
B|Uh, no, somebody else answered the phone and put my number in.|nn sd
A|Okay, it's, uh,|bk %
B|Uh, what is the topic?|qw
A|The topic is cars. What kind of car will you buy next and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why.|sd ^q ^q
B|Okay. Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac.|bk sd
A|Okay.|b
B|I've had, uh, well, I'm on my third one. And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, I'm the same way. I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs. I went to my first Lincoln this last time. I travel and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln|b sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I finally tried one after fifty years|sd
B|My,|%
A|and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars, but I bought a Lincoln and I like it.|sd sd sd
B|My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years, but I've always been a G M man. I'm in the auto parts business myself.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, are you?|bh
B|And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I just love it to death. I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it.|sd sv
A|Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman. I travel on the road so I like a little heavier car but,|sd sd sd %
B|I used to do that quite a bit myself.|sd
A|So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I tell you what, I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah, because I like the Lincoln but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better.|ny sd sv
B|They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better.|sv
A|I think so, too.|aa
B|And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash and, and the, the buttons are so small to push|sv sv sv
A|Yeah, they really do.|aa sd
B|and G M doesn't seem to do that. I kind of like that feature, so.|sv sd %
A|You know, I'm a funny duck that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments|h sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. They always appear to hold well.|sd sv
B|I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.|sd
A|Did you.|qy^d
B|And I had them do all four wheels.|sd
A|And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is, a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln and they're just not as large as before. I do miss that.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|That's true, yeah. But, what is big today.|sv aa qh
A|Well, you're right.|aa
B|You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been but,|sv %
A|Yeah, it's big, but the trunk space for me, uh, what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.|aa sv sd sd sd
B|You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.|sd
A|Yeah, now, I have the Town Car and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac.|b sd sd
B|Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh, or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh, good.|b ba
B|You know, straight across. I mean,|sd %
A|They went all the way down?|qy^d
B|Front to back.|na
A|Well, that's good.|ba
B|Not going from side to side.|sd
A|That's good.|ba
B|And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.|sd
A|Yeah, I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items, I sell guns, gun cases and things like that|b sd sd
B|I see. Yeah.|ba b
A|and I need to, you know, that's about the same size as a golf club.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that and,|sd %
B|I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.|qy^d
A|Nope.|nn
B|Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car|sv
A|Right.|b
B|because it's a V Six, but it, uh, I I drove it from here to Memphis and I really enjoyed driving that car. If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy.|sd % sd sd sv
A|Yeah. I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville. I usually fly. I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me. We drove it ten hours to Nashville, and it, it handled real well, but, my main thing is space, so if a Continental, I might consider it the next time, a Continental has more trunk space.|b sd sd sd sd sv sd sv sv sd
B|You might take a look at them. They, they had a, a lot more trunk space. As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had.|ad sv sd
A|You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?|qy
B|Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors, yeah.|na ny
A|Yeah, I like leather interiors also.|b sd
B|Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.|sd sd
A|That's a nice car. You bet, and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus,|sv ba sd
