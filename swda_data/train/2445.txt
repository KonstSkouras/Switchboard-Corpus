B|I, I don't like really camping in the rough. I like the, the, the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that.|sd sd
A|Yeah, we went, we went once to a lean-to and it, um, I mean, there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right, we only spent two nights there. I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights. I wouldn't want to go for like a week, but, um, two nights is good.|b sd % sd sd sd sd sd sv

A|Um, especially there was a little store close by, so, it was pretty nice.|sd sd
B|Yeah, the campsite that we went to was an area that, it's right on a big lake, and there's a lot of boating out there, and we, we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still, uh, it was still, too, cold.|b sd sd sd sd sd

A|Well, it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly. Um, I don't know, I was, I have a tent and I fluff out in it, in the backyard and stuff, but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get, it's dirty you know,|sd sd h sd sd sd % sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, you can't keep the dirt out of the tent. I don't know we have a seven year old, it's pretty funny, like stay out.|sd h sd sd %

A|Yeah, I don't know .|aa aa
B|Other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt out of it.|sv
A|Yeah, well, what we were doing, we were just going to say, we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, you know, no going in and out, and, or what he wants to do, we had brought his friend along, was play in the tent. It was like, no, this is not working, you can't do that, you get the tent all dirty.|b sd sd sd ^q ^q

B|Uh-huh. Um, did you have another, a big tent, like uh, um, like a, looks like a sitting area type, you know, like a two room type ?|b qy
A|No, but, you know, I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice and, um, up here we have, uh, we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime.|nn sd sd
B|Yeah, yeah, we don't really have a problem with that, um, in these areas, um, and even, even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs. And I noticed that, I know that I said, that's, I've, I've lived back east before, um, they,|b b sd sd % % sd
A|They're terrible, they're really terrible. Uh, but, there's this one campsite, that it, just some of them are known but there is one that's out in this big lake and its, its, its, mosquitoes are terrible and then there's this, there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir and there's no bugs, that's the whole thing that everyone told me, oh, I'm, I was going to go to, Little River State Park, that place is great, there's no bugs.|sv sv % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sv sd

B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah, that was, it's a really nice area, I've been there before and it's, I, I couldn't imagine living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued, they were plagued with them, with mosquitoes. And you can go out, outside in the daytime, all right, but the minute the sun went down, um, that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out.|ny sd sd % sd sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes, so, we didn't really contribute it to that. But, um, I think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes, I can't see all this little, uh, smoke buckets I call them,|sd sd sd sd

A|Oh, I'm in my paperwork here, that's what I do when I wait for a phone call, I get in my paperwork Oh, to find my most important parts.
