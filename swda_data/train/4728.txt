A|Uh, I have a Ford pickup and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan. And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen|sd sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|so, uh|%
B|Throw them in the back.|^2
A|they sort of fit our requirement. Yeah, I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh, seat  with a seat in the back.|sd b sd
B|Cab. Oh, yeah?|^2 bh
A|And so they just fit in there. When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.|sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room and, uh and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back|sd sd
B|There you go.|ba
A|and I kind of like having a pickup truck.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|Actually, I think of it as a as a car that'll last|sd
B|Right, yeah, I know.|b b ba
A|I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort. So, I'm pretty happy.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah, you're looking at, I got a Toyota Four Runner. I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too, so I got a Four Runner.|b % sd sd sd
A|So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. I, I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.|sd sd sd
B|You're just like me. I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.|sv sd
A|And, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz. I'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine|b sd sd
B|No.|aa
A|and I'll pay for the rest of it.|sd
B|Let somebody else break it in, right|sv b
A|Right. And, uh, the van we're we might go again on a, on a van. We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time. I'm not sure.|b sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, it certainly had that. We didn't do much to it at all.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So.|%
B|Yeah, my, my, pretty much the same. I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners|b % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to. I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it, I can throw, I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not.|sd sd sd % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it's real reliable, I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided, I don't know, it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world, but it blew a head gasket.|sd h sd sd
A|Uh-oh.|ba
B|Didn't do any damage to it. Uh, I caught  it real early.|sd sd
A|How, at how  at how many miles?|% qw
B|Uh, oh ninety-seven thousand.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So it's not real early|sd
A|You didn't overheat it?|qy^d
B|No. Never overheated it. I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant|nn sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Went out and looked. Saw it was, saw where it was coming from. Drove it right to the shop and left it off.|sd sd sd
A|Huh. Well that was, ,|b %
B|And that was it because I, I have that and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle. It, it's a I don't know, people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves|sd % h sd
A|I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining and, uh, uh, he's a, it's, he's pretty conservative guy. I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, uh,|sd % % sd sd
B|I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.|ba sv
A|I'm sure he does, yeah.|sd b
B|Yeah. So, you know, when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving? Yeah.|b % qh b
A|No|aa
B|And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least. Just for  the enjoyment.|sd
A|Yeah. Uh . Yeah|b % b
B|But, yeah, I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car, uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.|b sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very, I mean you got one. It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and,|sv sv sd %
A|If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.|sd
B|To have it out of the way. Right.|^2 b
A|But, uh, they're solid. Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,|sd sv
B|I think they last a lot longer than anything else.|sv
A|They're the only things Americans still know how to build and, uh|sv %
B|Yeah, yeah, the trucks do. Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too. But so are the, though I think the Chevies, I don't think the I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.|b b sd sv % sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.  At least until recently|sv
A|Right. I  I kind of like mine, yeah, so, mine's a Ford|b sd b sd
B|A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck. I mean, I don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, I heard about that, yes.|ba b
B|Oh, it's beautiful.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|That thing, that thing will last forever I mean ,|sv
A|That, that's a serious truck.|sv
B|Oh, yeah, that thing's, uh, it's got a boat engine in it|b % sv
