A|Okay, so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?|b qy
B|Um, I do some every now and then, I, I work and my wife's home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it.|ng sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.|sd
A|Yeah, do, do you like to cook.|b qy
B|Huh, yeah, I really like it,|ny sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|um, there's a few dishes, like, I, I grew up with the, um, you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.|% sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so we, we definitely have different tastes, so.|sd %
A|Yeah, yeah, but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff|b b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook I'm pretty bad. My husband is really good, he put himself through college working in restaurants.|b sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And, uh, he's much better cook than I am, so, when I was home I still cooked a lot and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff. And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking and the kids are thrilled, they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right|qy
A|Yeah, they say oh dad, let dad cook mom, let him do it But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids? You obviously have one.|ny sd ^q qy qy^d
B|Yeah, two, uh-huh.|ny sd ny
A|Okay, you have two.|bk bf
B|Yeah, one is, uh, nine months and the other is two and a half.|aa sd sd
A|Two and half, oh.|b^m
B|Yeah, that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,|b %
A|I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it Or are you not at that stage yet?|qy qrr
B|Yeah, it does|ny sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|she can make, uh, she makes six different meals, but.|sd %
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|Like to have one thing, you know, one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,|sd sd
A|Oh my gosh, I couldn't|ba sd
B|and then she makes noodles with, uh, with,  soy sauce or whatever,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, all things.|%
A|Boy, I couldn't do that, I|sd %
B|But, um, yeah, our favorite, let me think, I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made. I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy, and that was, um,  uh, scallops, uh, scallop, um,|b % ^h sd sd sd
A|What's that. Oh really.|qw b
B|it has a French name, it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it and you pour it over rice,|sd sd sd
A|Oh yeah, what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.|b qy
B|Yeah, uh.|ny
A|Scallops Saint something, or, yeah, .|sd %
B|Yeah, I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,|b sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|but, uh, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh the scallops.|sd
A|Really, with scallops.|b ^2
B|An, and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good.|sv sd
A|No, no, I'm from New England, so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here. And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.|ar ar sd sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That sounds great.|ba
B|Yeah, but, uh,|b %
A|I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party. We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game, they had, uh, a murder mystery,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was really fun and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves, but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game, so,  so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Right, yeah.|b b
A|and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that's, uh,|%
B|Yeah that's another thing I have a problem with my wife,|b sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|she, uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes. She likes the chicken and fish,|sd sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|and, like I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know, a lot,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so|%
A|I know, my husband did too His parents are Austrian and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table|ba sd sd sd
B|Oh yeah, red meat, plenty of good red meat.|b sv
A|Yeah, yeah, yeah.|aa aa aa
B|My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.|sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|My dad wouldn't know what to do.|sd
A|Oh, gosh, so do you,|ba %
B|Course, she grew up Catholic so you know, they,  they sort of come with the,|sd %
A|Oh, they did the,|%
B|there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have|sv
A|That you do, right, right, that's just part of it.|aa aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, we didn't, my family didn't, but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that, but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly, he never,|b sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there were several things that he liked but it never was really, something that he would have chosen. It's just that I cooked so he had to put up with it|sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans. I tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it, so I never, I had, I was limited. I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans, but.|sd sd sd sd % % sd sd %
B|Yeah, it's hard to get a protein content up then|b sv
A|Yeah, yeah. That's true|aa aa aa
B|Yeah, I like, I like them every now and then for a change, it's nice.|b sd sv
A|Yeah, some of the stuff is good, but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,|aa sv sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had little kids at the time, you know, when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking, I couldn't, I don't like to cook. And I'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking. So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.|sd sd sd sd sd ad
B|No, uh, he's all done.|ar sd
A|He's set, oh okay.|qy^d %
B|Yeah, yeah, I set him down.|ny ny sd
A|Okay. Do you like to bake at all, or do you, do you get into that's, that,|bk qy qrr
B|Yeah, we used to do that, um, my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know|ny sd sd
A|Yeah|b
B|after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it. But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.|sd sd
A|Really, no kidding.|b b
B|And, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days and that would be it.|sd sd
A|Yeah, then be gone. I know, that's the thing about baking. I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all and I, I can do a pretty good pie, we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it.|b b ba sv sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, so I can make a pretty mean pie, but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening. We had the same kind of problem. If you make homemade bread,|sd sv sd sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I mean, it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat It tastes so good.|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh, we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um, you ever seen the, the starter bread, I can't remember what it's called, they call it the, um, Amish bread here but,|aa sd qy sd sd %
A|Oh, uh, yeah.|ny
B|uh, it's made with, you just leave it out,|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, and you let it spoil sort of.|sd
A|Yeah, uh-huh, I've heard of that, I've heard of it, but I've never done it.|ny ny sd sd
B|You know, yeah.|b
A|That sounds pretty good.|ba
B|Yeah, it tasted pretty good, really.|aa sd
A|Yeah, oh yeah.|b b
B|But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it, but.|sd sd %
A|Yeah, and then you you make the bread but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.|b sd sd
B|Yeah right, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and that's how they continue the thing.|b b sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, it sounds, it always sounded, I don't know how safe that was|b b b % qh
B|Yeah, I know it sounded strange to me too, I figure, well you're baking it so, you know, yeah.|aa sd sv %
