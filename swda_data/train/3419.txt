A|Uh, Kate, what kind of, uh, where do you like to eat out?|qw
B|Well, we, uh, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and, uh, so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out, and so, uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, uh, restaurant there, and I think they have one of the best services that, uh, that we really like it.|sd sd sd
A|Do you? Have you tried Mother Mesquites?|bh qy
B|No. Where's that at?|nn qw
A|That's at Skillman and L B J|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there is, it's where Skillman, uh, curves into Forest Lane|sd sd

B|Oh.|b
A|They're both very good.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny

B|yeah, something something like that,|aa aap_am
A|uh-huh|b
B|uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.|b b sd
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|Uh, much better. Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites but then fajitas are one of my, uh, I like it better than just about anything|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|and they make very good fajitas there in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.|sv
B|Yes. Oh.|aa b
A|Especially with butter and honey on them|sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, I know, I tell, I tell you what. They are, they just, um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food. I wish I could make them here at home.|b b aa fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv sd

A|Yes, now I haven't eaten there. Have you eaten there?|b sd qy
B|Yes. I have eaten there. Now the only problem, *note the setup for a negative comment I love the food. It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood,|ny sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, the service has always been so strange, every time I've been in there. Mostly it's been at lunch time|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, but I hear at night though they have, uh, you know, the outdoor, um, bar, and, um, uh, that's it's really, uh, you know, kind of lively.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.|sv
A|Oh, I, we like, uh, uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's a good restaurant.|sd
B|Oh, well that sounds great.|ba
A|And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, uh, uh, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|The service is great. They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too. If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.|sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Oh well, I, uh, I have children and, and work, and so we, uh, we can eat a lot of fast food|b sd sd
A|I can remember when our children were small.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We lived in the Chicago area at the time, and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out.|sd sd
B|Yeah I know.|b ba
A|I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.|sd
B|I, I know, I, I'm so sick of McDonalds, and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time. And, so now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint.|aa sd sd sd
A|Well, Taco Bueno's good|sv
B|Oh and, and cheap too.|sv
A|And cheap, and cheap.|b^m b

A|Yes, yes yes. Sounds like my grandchildren.|b b b ba
B|Yeah, I know. They, they, they're just spoiled rotten, but, uh, but, no, I, uh, uh, we love to eat out, of course, it's just so much easier and simpler|b ba sd % sd sv
A|Oh, yes.|aa
B|yeah. So we, uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week.|b sd
A|Well, it's just my husband and I, and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.|sd sd
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners|sd
B|Oh, me too, me too. So, I know, uh, I, I know that I, uh, you know, I just work and I'm just tired when I get home and I, I just don't feel like cooking.|aa aa sd sd sd
