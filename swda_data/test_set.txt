A|Yeah, I think, um, this is a tough subject because, uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, uh, the political views are really different. I, uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion but like gun control and, uh, day care an things like that, and there are some very different views, uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.|sv sv sd
B|Well, now you, you say two different parts of the country what, are, are, are you referring to yourself or,|sd qy %
A|Yeah, well being in, in Baltimore see, Maryland is, um, is sort of, um, is as, as a hub of liberalism  you know, compared to the country, uh, you know, very, uh, in, in many ways, uh, very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York, uh, I, aren't actually as liberal, Maryland is a very liberal, uh, state so, so, where here we have, um, we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know.|ny sd sv sd sv sv sd sd sv sd

B|Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched.|sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was very different it was a whole,  different view. It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know, at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that because I'd really never met people that did, and now, I talk to people that do.

Well it's that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh, though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself I I I think uh you know but I I still what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh|b % % sv sv sv sd sv % sv b

A|Uh, I Yeah, I and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable. Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. Yeah Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right|% % sv sv % qy^d

A|Well Brent, I've been, um, I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought, uh, if it, it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make, because, um, it was important to me to, to spend some time with kids.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I know that when I was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was, it was really hard on our family because I would, he would come home and I would leave,|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and then when I would come home and he would leave, and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know, someone came home and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something. It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. So there's one or two nights a week, we have a, on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening and we stay home that evening, all of us, and we do things together.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My oldest is, uh, four and my youngest is about to turn three. Two girls. And they are a handful|sd sd b sd

B|Yes. We've, my, uh, well, when we first got married, my wife worked for a year. Then we decided to have kids.|aa sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, she, she got pregnant and then we decided she would stay home with the kids. We would make that sacrifice. It is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we made that decision and, uh, so after she had the first baby, she stayed home. And, and we had a second baby and she's still at home|sd sd sd sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And so, uh, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know, I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in. Most of them, uh, continue to work if they have, have kids.|sd sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I only have one other person I know in my, in my group here that works where the wife stays home, and that's because of religious values as well. They're Baptists and they, and they think that's important.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day-care and, and leave them and, I don't know, I just don't want, I just don't want strangers raising my children.|sv sv sd
A|Well, no, and it's, it's just not, um, it's not as stable for the kids,|aa sv
B|Right.|b
A|and they, everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. But, uh, it's, yeah.|sd %
B|That's how it is at our house when you're on the phone. Oh, it's open, anything goes when mom's on the phone|sd ^q ^q
A|Well, it's also important, I think, um, for my husband. I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, um, some time with them.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and he reads to them,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and he spends about an hour doing that, and that's, that's pretty good quality time, with them,|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and, um, but it's hard for him on Saturdays. He, he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,|sd sd
B|With all the yard work and things like that.|qy^d
A|and so, um, I try to say, well, why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something.|sd ^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Right, we feel that, you know, just spending time together. You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, you know, that costs money or, or, you know, that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that. It's just the kids like to, being together as a family.|b b sv sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run and so we took the kids and, and went by the Farmers Market down in, in, down there in Garland.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the, you know, the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out. And they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet, you know,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they liked that. And then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an F A, F A A, Future F A, Future Farmers of America, F F A going on there,|sd sd sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in this, in the, in this schoolyard there. So we just said, hey, let's stop and and the kids got to go around and, you know, see pigs and animals and things like that,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and for them that's wonderful, you know. They, they thought it was the greatest fun, you know, and it didn't cost any money. And, uh, you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.|sd sd sd sv
A|Well, that's right. But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends are that, um, the family unit is devaluated. It's not nearly as important.|aa sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And families took care of themselves and, um, but now, you know, people don't, they don't support each other that way.|sv sv
B|Right. Right. Oh, definitely motherhood is devalued in this society. If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's like what a waste. People think, you know, you should be fulfilling yourself|b aa sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and a mother isn't an important important thing as, as having a career|sv
A|That's right and,|aa %

A|my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum, so we can't, can't ever recycle them. I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.|sd sd sd sv
B|Um, now I didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|It was good talking to you.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|Uh, bye.|fc
B|All right, bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said, where were they|fc fc t3
A|Okay, Jerry, I guess tonight's topic is about recycling.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano.|sd
B|All right.|b
A|Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your garbage can. Uh, you can put out newspaper, you can put out glass, you can put out aluminum cans, you can put, put out certain types of plastic material and that is on a roll out effort right now. Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, uh, participate right now, but, uh, that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so. And those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum. And I think, uh, overall that's an, an excellent opportunity because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, uh, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today, but for the future also. So,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sv sd %
B|Yeah, uh, I was|b %
A|How about your community?|qo
B|My community, that's cute. I live in a place called Dye Mound.|b ba sd
A|Dye Mound?|br
B|Or Dye Community.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's not a city, not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, I can't even see their house and, uh,|sd sd sd %
A|Sounds like a place where I grew up|sd
B|Yeah, I mean, uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness. Literally.|b sd
A|Well, I like it.|sd
B|And, uh, well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, I mean, to the asphalt, we're out there.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things.|sd
A|Well, good.|ba
B|I'm building our house right now and I'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.|sd sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|hopefully, it's not my wife.|sd
A|Well, let's hope not. You can be, uh, get in trouble for that.|ad sv
B|Well, I thought I'd, you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. I don't know if you're familiar with that operation, but, what you do is you just build up the pressure|sd qy^d sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then you go over and release it and then it just, it just drops, you know.|sd sd
A|Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?|qy
B|Very similar, yeah.|na ny
A|Okay, okay.|bk bk
B|Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, but you, it won't go down.|sd sd
A|Yes, until you release it.|b qy^d
B|Until you pull the pin, yeah.|arp_nd %
A|All right.|b
B|Anyway I have another, uh, recycling method I use.|sd
A|I think, Yes.|% b
B|You know all that junk mail you get?|qy
A|Oh, yes, I sure do.|ny sd
B|The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
B|Because, uh, well, like I say, we live a way and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.|sd sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And I don't like that|sd
A|No.|b
B|so I don't do that. So I take it and I send, and I mail it back to them.|sd sd sd
A|Well, great. That's excellent.|ba ba
B|I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.|sd
A|Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that. One thing,|sv ba sd sv %
B|Yeah. Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.|b sv
A|Right.|b
B|For instance, uh, I saw a thing on, uh, NOVA, I think it was the other day.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|This guy has designed recyclable materials, I mean recyclable items.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|If it's metal, it's all out of metal. It's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff.|sd sd
A|Well, that's a great idea, that's a great idea.|ba ba
B|And, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale.|sv
A|Products. Yes.|^2 aa
B|Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and somebody will find a way to make money at it.|sv
A|Yes, they will.|aa aa
B|And,|%
A|Exactly.|aa
B|Well, there is a guy in Dallas, that's all he does.|sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|He collects trash. You know, and,|sd %
A|Well, that's a full time job.|sv
B|Yeah, well, he's, he's out for cardboard.|aa sv
A|Yes, well, I've found out, too, that, uh, you know, a couple years ago, we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years, and at one time we could get a pretty good return, uh, with the Boy Scouts. We could take and collect the newspaper,|aa sd sd sd sd
B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Oh, you like the rain, do you?|qy

A|Are you?|bh
B|I like the heat.|na
A|Well, I have a friend who's the same way, and anything below sixty, she's just not happy but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, my husband's from Nebraska, and they have more of the four seasons.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah, and I'm from Utah, so, I, I like, the four seasons|b sd sd
A|Oh, you're used to that, too.|bf
B|I just don't like the cold.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It goes from hot, and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer, and then it's cold|sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I wish it were several months of that.|sd
B|The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.|sd
A|Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh, some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go, and it's sleeping time. But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Well, we have several children that are in sports, and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.|sd sd
A|Oh, yeah. Well, sure it does. That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.|b aa sv
B|I like it better, I think.|sd
A|And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|But I did a walk last night, and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.|sd sd sv
B|The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity, that part I don't care about.|sd sd
A|Well, I agree, absolutely, and you know, it's all relative, because I was from West Texas, and it was very dry, and so I thought Dallas was awful, and I still think so, but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week, and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning. They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.|aa sv sd sd sd sv sd sd sd

B|Oh, is that right?|bh
A|Yes. I do not like the|ny sd
B|Well another reason, well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. We have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,|% sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain, or, it seems they thrive when it rains, they just, really,|sd sd sd %
A|Yeah, I think so too. I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains|aa aa sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|but it seems like here, I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.|% sd sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|aa aa
A|So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,|sd

A|I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.|sd

A|Okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qw
B|Well, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions. I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska, and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms, and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else, but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food|sd sd sd sv sv
A|Yes, true.|aa aa
B|and, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time, I lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting and I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.|sd
A|Yeah, I can, I can understand that. I was raised in Oklahoma, and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh, yeah, the hunting and everything, and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all, and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it, but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs. Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing. But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight|aa ba sd % % % sd sd sv sd sd
B|Yeah, it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, and, uh.|aa sv sv sv %
A|Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas, and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, and of course it was definitely there. So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. I don't know what the answer is. I know that it's scary, and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.|sv sv sd sd sd sv sd sd sd sv sd sv
B|I, I think so, and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one, and, uh, and then, uh.|aa sd %
A|Well, it's very true.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too. I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.|sd sv sv
B|Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.|aa aa ba
A|Because even if you said, okay, you know, armed forces could have them, some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.|sv ^q sv
B|Yeah, and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh, and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.|aa sv sv
A|That's very true very true. Who knows, we maybe want to overthrow the government|aa aa qh sv
B|Well, the way things are going.|sv
A|I know, if somebody doesn't do something. Uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?|aa sv qo
B|Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much, and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.|sd sv

A|Wow.|ba
B|Uh, the Nissan came and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it served our needs. Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for.

A|Yeah.|aa

If nothing else, see how the city works, stuff like that.|sv sv sv sv
A|Yeah, I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh.|b sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|No kids,|sv
B|I kind of, I think so, too. I think that's a bit dramatic, but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing, helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah. I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.|aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I, I'd force them. I think that, uh, I think it would be, I think I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.|sv sv sv
B|Your right, I do, too, I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts a video doing|aa aa sv
A|Right, exactly. I was a, I was a Boy Scout. As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do, you know, projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project.|aa aa sd sd sd
B|Right, that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you involved real good and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.|aa sd sd sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Something,|%
A|I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.|sv
B|I do, too. I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that. And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out. I think that's good and,|aa sv sv sv %
A|Well, we have a funny commercial around here. It says something like, if people were to give five, hours a week or five percent of their salary, we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something. So,  I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could, uh,|sd sd sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.|sv

B|Right.|b
A|my kid will do four or five hours this week for me. No problem.|sv sv
B|Yeah, it sounds pretty good That sounds good. I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff, and I think that's pretty neat. They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over|aa ba ba sd sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|I've seen that. Yeah.|sd %
B|And keep it clean. I think that's I pretty good idea. And I think, you know, again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older.

B|So, uh,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.|sd sv sd
A|Nursing homes.|^2
B|But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,|sd
A|Visit.|^2

A|That's right.|aa
B|I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.|sd sv
A|You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have to say that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.|sv
B|Oh, I do too.|aa
A|Um,|b
B|Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.|sv
A|Right, right.|aa aa
B|Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|I hope so.|sd
B|Anyway.|%
A|You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.|sv
B|Right. Oh, it's tough I'm sure.|b aa
A|And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.|sv
B|Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.|b aa sv %
A|And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision I think.|sv sv
B|It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh. I think that's right,|b aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.|sd sd sd

A|Yeah. Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know, and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.|b sv sv sv

A|Uh-huh. Right, right. Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right. I, I teach swim lessons a lot, and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know, kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.|b aa aa % sv sd sd sv

B|Right. That's, Right.|aa % aa
A|Um, thinking about it, some of the ways I try and keep up on current events is, uh, I enjoy reading the newspaper, but, uh, quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper, and so, uh, I enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also, uh, some of the news periodicals, uh, weekly magazines, and, uh, at work I also have, uh, management summary reports that, uh, give basically a lot of the current events. Uh, how about yourself?|sd sd sd qo
B|Well, I'm like you. I don't, I don't, I like to read the paper but I basically don't do it every day, and I, um, I usually watch, uh, either GOOD MORNING, AMERICA or the TODAY SHOW, every morning while I'm, you know,|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|whatever I'm doing, I watch that. I usually watch the news, either at, you know, early evening or at ten o'clock|sd sd
A|Right, right.|b b
B|so I get it from T V a lot. I get TIME I read TIME MAGAZINE Um, that's one I read pretty regularly.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah. Okay.|ba bk
B|And, uh.  The thing about it, you know, now that I've found, is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE, there's nothing in it you don't know.|sd
A|You think that that's, uh, pretty adequate coverage and you get. Uh-huh. It's historic events, huh.|bf % b qy
B|Right. Then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something, because really, I've thought lately, there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE.|na sv
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|You know, it's, it's, basically you've heard everything|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|and, uh, you might, you might get a little more thorough, uh, account of something, but really, um, I don't know. So I get most of mine from television|sv h sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I would say.|h
A|Um, I found out too, that, uh, quite often if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, uh, understanding or, or get, want to know more about it, that the, the newspaper or, uh, I read NEWSWEEK, can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V, but, uh, um, I found out that also on, on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N and, and like you said, the, the news shows that are, that are happening, and you can read some more about it if you want to. Um, I found out, though that, or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative. There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news, or, or bad news. And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.|sd sd sd sv sd sv sv sv
B|Right|b
A|And, uh.|%
B|and I, I think there's an attempt to do that. You know, I think people, there's a mild attempt for that, but I think basically, we basically associate news with bad news or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.|sv sv sv sv
A|Yes, we do.|aa sv
B|I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen. It's more negative, like you said.|sv sv
A|True, true.|aa aa
B|But, I think people try to, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff, but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. I've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, but that takes time, that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing|b sd sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things, so. I don't know, I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media|sv h sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we have to pay that price, but, uh, I don't know, I don't know. It's interesting, and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,|sv h h sv sv
B|Right. You know, the war last winter was certainly a good example of that  because we saw every single thing, practically.|b sv
A|Exactly. We saw, Yes, you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that. So.|aa % aa sv %
B|I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered. I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen|sd sd
A|Oh, yes.|ba
B|I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,|sd
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah.|ba b
B|and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with|sv

B|Okay.|bk
A|In fact, I am at work right now. Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela. Uh, I think what is really important, uh, of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job. And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits. Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.|sd oo_co_cc sv sv sd qy^d
B|Right.|na
A|Okay. And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. And, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.|bk ad
B|Okay.|aa
A|Like, uh, perhaps, uh, he has, uh, the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family, uh, uh, and how much coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um, probably dental. How important you think that would be.|sd sd
B|Right. I, I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.|aa sv
A|Because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.|bf
B|Exactly,|aa
A|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|right.|aa
B|Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,|sv
A|And they always have surprises for you.|bf
B|Exactly,|aa
A|With children,|b^m
B|they always do.|sv
A|You know, and so, it's, it is, uh, we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.|% sd
B|Yeah, I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.|aa sv
A|You would still have something.|^2
B|Exactly. You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.|aa bf
A|Right.|aa
B|Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.|sv
A|Yes. Uh-huh. They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.|aa b sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles and professions.|sv
B|Yeah. Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.|b sd

B|Exactly.|aa
A|Yeah. No, I understand that totally|b fo_o_fw_"_by_bc ba

A|Oh, I hear , Yes, that's true.|b aa aa
B|And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.|sv
A|Yes. Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting? Do you think that would be, acceptable?|aa qy qy
B|I think I, think it would be fair.|sv na
A|I do too.|aa
B|I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.|sv
A|Right, that you, Right. That's right.|aa % aa aa
B|But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.|sv
A|With the company than,  than having to go, That's , that's right. Yes, I, agree with that.|^2 % aa aa aa

B|Uh, cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,|sd

B|You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.|sv

Many of them had been promised by the C I A, during the war over there, that because they co-operated with the C I A, and they helped the C I A out, that when they came here, the C I A would help establish them in America, and the C I A, of course, isn't doing that.|sv sd sd sd sd sd sd

And I never thought, well, I guess that is something you need to know, you know. People getting into trouble because they come here, and so they start farming on, uh, available land, you know.

People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic. And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better.

And they bred a dog that I it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you. That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them, because they would turn on on their handlers.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible. So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this. So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be. Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Huh.|b

A|Huh.|b
B|This is bred for, and they had to go through and destroy a, for a while there, about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred.|sd sd

A|I, I just don't feel right so. There's lots of places if you're going to go camping. K O A are wonderful. It's kind of it's kind of the, uh, yuppie type of camping because they have showers, they have things for kids to do. They have swimming pools, things like that.

B|Oh, my.|ba
A|we have found state parks, not that they're lacking but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner. You've got the showers available. It's not, you know, in the same category. State parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different. But, so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. That's the only time you really use your campground. If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Pardon me?|br
B|I'll let you lead out.|oo_co_cc
A|Okay, well, there's, uh, it's kind of an interesting topic and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh, not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know, you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World, and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned, and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period. We're also have a very humongous trade deficit, and, uh, and that's kind of frightening. Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life, and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime, and so I think, uh, you know, things, there's been an awful lot of social change lately, and and, uh.|aa % sd sv sv sd sd sd sd sv sv sd % sv % %
B|I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the, they seem to be social, they seem to be economically driven also.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing. And, of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now. One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.|sv sd qh
A|True.|aa
B|I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it must have been terribly boring to go through,  your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.|sv
A|Yes, yes.|aa aa
B|Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that, that aspects changing.|sv
A|True, true.|aa aa
B|And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good, but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Well, do, do you think that's good or bad?|b qy
B|I think it's great.|sv
A|You think that's great.|b^m
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|That's some, yeah, because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position, they, they're very comfortable, they lose the ability to learn, and they in a sense become unteachable. They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five, and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education, and, and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.|% % sv sv sv sv sv sv sv
B|I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for, for people to face.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Right. I agree with that, I agree with that. But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn|b aa aa aa sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|learn how to adapt, learn how to grow in the, in their college or whatever education they might take. Well, that, that's good, that's good.|sv sv sd sd
B|There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about. I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.|sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.|sv
A|Yeah, I, I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.|b sd

A|Huh, that, you're the opposite of me. I drive an hour each way to work and so if I just use time and not say one, which quality is the best, I guess, that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio and then newspapers and T V would be tied after that because maybe I'll catch the, the evening news, like ten o'clock on T V and I,|% sd sd sd sd sd sd %

Because a lot of times, it, here, you know, I'll talk to some people here and I'll mention someone's, some talk host and I'll expect them to have an opinion on why I don't like him and don't listen, they don't even know, you know, what the guys name is, uh. Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States. Most people haven't heard of Bruce Williams. You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.|b sd sd sd sv sd sv sv

You might remember the name Bruce Williams, and he, he is again, national and talks about a lot of financial things. But, the here, I just get a kick out of, uh, well we do a lot of gardening here, so there's, we have an excellent gardener here, has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday. Of course that's not exactly current events. But, I, I'm, I am kind of a radio buff.|sd % % sd % % sd sd sd sd sd sd % sd sd sd sd
B|I listen to the radio, uh, probably five or six hours a week, but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical, uh, station here ,  for music purposes.|sd sd

A|Yeah.|b

A|Oh, yeah. That's good. Actually,|b ba %
B|That we, we wake up to television news and, uh, uh, shower and dress, and whatever to that, and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together, uh, in a car, we, we chat at each other rather than, than something else.|% sd sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car, so we have the advantage of being able to, uh, read and drive although there seems to be, from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving|sd sd
A|My wife always wonders about that she says, look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time|sd sd
B|So, we, we rely pretty, pretty heavily, I think, on a combination of the, of the two. I also, uh, use, uh, NEWSWEEK magazine. Uh,|sv sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the, the, uh, news magazine of the year for us.|sd
A|Right. we get,|b %

So, uh, I guess I use about eighty percent written, is probably my input and twenty percent, uh, television. I, I think I respect the, from a journalistic perspective current events.|sd sd sv
A|Go ahead ,|ad

A|Oh, yeah. It comes and goes.|b sd
B|Uh, we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh. There, there are other, uh, uh, I'm not sure what you would call them, they the small, uh, competing independent sort of newspapers.

B|Uh, it depends. It, it's, has decent national coverage, but has an extremely focused political coverage, probably steeped in,  the southern history and the fact that this is a Democratic State.|sd sv

A|Yeah.|b

B|Yeah, we, we have, that is, uh, as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section, we, and we pay it sort of glancing nod. We, uh, have a very good friend who is, uh, tapped into the city planning structure. Uh, our developer architect friend and,|ny % % sd sd sd %

B|Uh, and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than, than the paper would have anyway.|sv
A|My wife and I, you know, as mentioned, the question was, uh, do you get it from people too. And, and, I can say the same thing you do that, uh, my wife is, uh, she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and say, you didn't read the, uh, well, I always read the sports, uh, what am I thinking of, uh, the commentaries, I can't even think of what it is offhand, and she's always reading something, and she says, why haven't you read that.

B|Okay.|b
A|We have it in the break area, C N N. And, but the reason I say that is on the radio they'll say and look at this, you know. And when I first heard C N N, it only started about, uh, since the war, you know, or right before that. And, they would always say and look at this, and there would be a pause, you know, would be music and stuff and I realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the, uh, the news.|sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Yeah, I've, I've heard that, yeah.|b sd %
B|Uh, almost an addition, uh, and, and, and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in, in unhooking, uncoupling from the events, and going on with their. So,|% sd %
A|Right|b
B|instead of being, watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. Uh, and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war, I guess about two and a half or three weeks in, we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would, uh, watch, uh, fifteen minutes before, fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news, or our local news. We would watch C N N until six thirty, then we would watch, uh, a rotating network news of either, uh, A B C, C B S, or N B C and we, we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.|sd sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on, on news that way. And, then we would do a similar thing, uh, at uh, ten forty-five because, uh, C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage, uh, and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would, would have better state coverage rather than local coverage.

B|Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?|qw

A|you can't get all of us.|^q

A|Yeah.|b
B|here you break in, and you're going to get shot.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.|b sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's not many from the local communities.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, it's a problem, and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|would be a definite deterrent and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, I, I tend to agree with you. I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.|b aa aa sv
A|Right.|b
B|And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship. And they lose their constitutional rights. You know,|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.|sv

It may be improved by now but,|b b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd %
B|That's what I've heard.|sd

B|Oh. Oh, that's neat.|b ba
A|Yeah, and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.|aa sd

B|Yeah. Uh-huh, well from what I I saw a statistic just a few days ago, um, so far this year, or was it during the last year, during a year's time, I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. So I, I, and it's building up, you know, they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.|b b % sd sd % sv sv sv
A|Yeah, what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.|aa sv

A|And, uh, here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons, uh, just,|sd %
B|Yeah, everybody's got that.|aa sv
A|Yeah, but I mean, in, here it's, uh, to the point where they were letting prisoners go. Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser crimes,  in order to put more people in, into the jails.|aa % sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|And it was just, uh, amazing to me, and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,  and being rearrested an.|sd sd
B|Yeah. Isn't, isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was.|b qy
A|Uh, I can't remember. Refresh my memory.|no ad

A|Um, I don't remember myself.|sd
B|Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right?|qy qrr
A|Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference. Right now,  I don't see it making a difference.|sv sv
B|If it,|%
A|I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death. I mean,  most people out there committing murders don't care.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|They just don't care.|sv
B|Yeah. Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care, it's not because the punishment, but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.|aa sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|The police don't catch them, or the courts don't convict them, or, or they don't serve very much of the time and so, uh, you know, their, their success rate is very high. Crime does pay, you can make a good living at it.|sv sv sv sv ^q ^q
A|Yeah, yeah, and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that, uh, have and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust, and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.|aa aa sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year. I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.|sd sd
B|Last year it was D C, I guess Baltimore caught them.|sd qy^d
A|Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,|na sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and, uh, once you kill off a few of them|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.|sv
B|Yeah, the only consolation is so many of the murders are, you know, the, the violent people going against each other and so they, you know, society's not going to put them to death, well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. Uh, I think, I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, you know, this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently.|aa sv sv % sv sv sv ^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, I, I personally think life imprisonment, I don't think much of of life imprisonment. First of all, it's never, turns out to be life, but second, you know, why should we, the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. Well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again, well then, why bother. Just execute them, because that's, that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.|sv sv qh sv sv qh sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty So,|sv %
A|Yeah, you know, it makes sense, um, you know, you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused, but I mean, uh, so few and far between, uh, you know, makes good T V movies and that's about it.|aa ba sv sv sv
B|Yeah, and, and also, um, the, the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, and that way we can be sure, you know, we can find out the truth, we can find out what really happened and, and base the sentence on what the person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear|sv sv sv

B|Yeah, well, you know, you just have to decide, you know, well there's really two separate decisions there I guess, one is, did it really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know, is this man really guilty, and you have to decide that, but then you have to decide, you know, as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing.|b sv sv qh qh sv qh

B|Uh-huh. Yeah. Well the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. I mean, I can handle people, people selling drugs, you know, it's, it's wrong, but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for. But we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.|b b sd % sd sv sv sv

B|Yes, oh, of course.|ny sd
A|Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, I guess. I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan. Other than that, I mean, you know, when I've, you know, when you grow up in a city that has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it.|sv sd sv
B|Yeah, well, the Cowboys were America's football team,|aa sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|there's no question about that, so.|sv %
A|Yeah, I mean it, it was really exciting, growing up when, when the Cowboys were really big. Because my parents would always have season tickets, and they'd go to all the games, and you know, the hype were just unbelievable. It's just, you know, the last, oh I guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really, but, you know, I'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys, and, you know, Super Bowl, and all this other stuff. So, I can't, you know, I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. I mean, I think they'll pull out of it, and, you know, they'll, they'll wind up being good again. They've got some, lot of really good young players that are going to, that are going to, uh, do pretty good, I think. But, they're raising prices on their tickets. So they're banking on doing good next season. I think tickets are,|aa sd sd sd sd % sv sd % sd sv sv sv sd sv sv
B|Again.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?|qw
A|Thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets. See, they, they sectioned it out even more. They used to just have like, uh, first of all it was all one price. And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. And now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one, just on the lower levels is the highest price, and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level, and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas, and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end, the direct end zones. But, um, they have about four or five different prices now, that they're structuring it with, but obviously yeah, they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.|qy^d
A|Um, you know, I'm not sure, I'm not positive, I didn't, I didn't really think about that. I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper. But, not that I'll ever go. I hadn't been to a Cowboys game, time, last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that, um, N F L strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there, and it was the, uh, Dallas and Washington Redskins game. And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets, and they, um, if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else. So my dad, I went with my dad to a game that one time. But that wasn't a real, you know, it was, it was the scab teams, it was kind of, you know, it was kind of different, I guess. And before that it's been quite a few years. I've been wanting to go to a game, I just never, never have gotten around to it.

A|I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy, it seems like, and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there, but, But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,|sd sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that|aa sd sd sd

A|but, but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, I, it's hard to say. Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better.|% sd sv sv sv

A|Right.|b
B|I, I, everything is so automated, uh, and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,|% sv sv
A|Yeah, Yeah.|b b
B|and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.|sv
A|Right. Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something, so|aa sv %
B|Well, yeah, that's that's true.|aa aa

B|Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.|b sd sd
B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|All right.|b
B|Um, I, I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think,|%
A|Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.|aa sd
B|Yeah, yeah. I think that it probably would be a, a good program. I think probably two years is too long.|b b sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think maybe a year would be, the longest.|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long.|b aa aa aa
B|Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.|b sv sv
A|That's right. That, that would be the problem. Sure would.|aa aa
B|Yeah. So I think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,|b b aa sv
B|Yeah. Right.|b b
A|I'm not sure what but,|sd %
B|Right. College credit is a good idea because,|aa aa
A|I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know, a super do salary of any kind.|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|but that, that kind of takes away from public service.|sv
B|That's right Yeah, they probably couldn't do anything monetary, but I think, giving, giving some kind of college credit,|aa aa sv sv
A|But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail, that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know. I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.|sv sv
B|No, I don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up and I'm not that familiar with them to know,|aa sv sd
A|I'm not either really.|sd
B|But, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|You know,|b
A|That's right.|aa
B|and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.|sv
A|Uh-huh. That's right. Absolutely. They need, young families, whatever,|b aa aa sv
B|So, it's, it's a really tough question. That's right.|sv aa
A|they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|Oh,|b
B|and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year|sv
A|That's right, uh-huh.|aa aa
B|and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,|sv
A|Uh-huh, it sure would. It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like that, I would think.|aa aa sv
B|Yeah. I, you know, I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program,|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|aa aa
B|it has to be something that's voluntary. You know, which is pretty much the way it is now. They might,|sv %
A|That's right. I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.|aa sd
B|Yeah, and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,|aa sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b
B|and you've a choice of where you want to go.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.|sv
A|Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.|aa sv
B|Yeah, in their own community, right. Yeah, that's true Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents|aa b aa aa aa sv
A|That's right. Yeah, that's, that's true too. That's true too.|aa aa aa aa
B|But, they would have to be supported in some way, and I'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.|sv sv
A|Yeah, yeah. Me neither. And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,|aa aa sd qh
B|Right.|b

B|Right, exactly.|aa aa

A|Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm not sure either. But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.|b b sd sv
B|Yeah. Yeah. I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.|b aa sv
A|Yeah.|b

And we have tried several years in a row, and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer, and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden|sd ^h sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Well, that's it. Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January, and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it, and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something|ba sd sd sd
B|Wow. Uh-huh.|ba b

B|Oh, yeah, my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me|b sd

And, uh, I, I was in England once, and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it. You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.|sd % sd sd % sd sd sd sd

B|yeah, that's really lovely. I would love to have different fruit trees. It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches. They're just delicious.

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and um, that's really what makes the most sense, because you don't have to use so much water, and|sv sv %
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it really does the job. But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. And if you're not really committed to it, I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week, and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something, and by then it's burned up, you know.|sv sd sv sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives, so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that|sd sd
A|Well, I would assume, too, I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah, it just gets so hot so fast here. We don't have really a Spring or a Fall|b b sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago. In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it. I'll never forget. Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner. I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him They remodeled the entire back yard.

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They certainly enjoy that part of it It's just trying to keep anything.

B|Well, I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years, you know, their carefree years|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but people that I have known that have done that, like from other countries, especially, from Germany and Finland, um, they are just, they have such a better, more mature, outlook on life|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|and I think they're better people because of it,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they're much more responsible. I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.|sd sd
A|You know, I, I really agree with you. Um, I, uh, though I've never done that myself, I, I'm, was a basically an education major when I graduated from college and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to, um, very rural children in a very low income district and I spent a year teaching there|aa sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I did it, um, for one reason I wanted, I was working on a masters degree so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think, um, in fact, if I had to do it all again I, you know, after that, you know, you never think of it because, I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.|sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Um, so that was, that was one reason why I never considered it but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans, I, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|um, I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed|sd
B|Huh. and rattling in|%

B|Yes. Yes.|ny ny
A|Because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought, you know, that really, now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.|sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I just, there, you know, they came from poverty, they were going to condition in poverty and it was, it was, the school district couldn't hire many people, it was very difficult for them to hire, and I think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, um, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, um, things, I think it's a really good idea.

B|Uh, I think something will have to be done down there very soon about, uh, about Mexico and, and, uh, some of the other areas, but, but, with the Persian Gulf, as you said, it's just, uh, been very quiet. I, I keep pretty close tabs on the paper and you don't hardly see a, unless it's there and we're just not seeing it.|sv sv sd sv sd
A|Well, the only, uh, references that I have seen lately has been, uh, in, part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things, and, and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, uh, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.|sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Well that's,|b %
A|I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq, but that,|sv %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,|sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.|b b sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us, it seems to come in cycles.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. And I know when I spent, the time that I've studied in Mexico, uh, Spanish was one of my majors in college, that, uh, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|about, uh, like you say, using them, our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|and that we weren't normally very interested in them, and they have, in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know, that they have corruption, and, and they don't have, uh, I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.|sv % sv sv sv sd
B|Right, and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and their economy is, of several of the countries, especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable. It's just a, you know, such a small amount, and it it just, it, uh, cuts off just a trickle, and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, that will be another big problem.|% % sv sv % % sv sv sv
A|Well, that's right, because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming|ba sv sv
B|Right, right.|b b
A|And they don't look at it so much as, you know,|sv
B|And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.|sv
A|Uh-huh. That's right.|b ba
B|If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.|sv
A|And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from the from South America, and Central America.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.|b b b
A|There's really a disparity between the, uh, what a I would call civilization of the countries, you know.|sv
B|we're just so much wealthier, and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.|sv
A|Yes, it's really kind of sad, and, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, right in our own back door.|aa sv
B|Yeah. That's right. Our own hemisphere, but we've, that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.|b b bf % sv
A|Um.|%
B|So, uh,|%

B|Nancy.|sd
A|Nancy, that's right,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and I'm Brian.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Just a moment Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.|ad sd
B|Right.|b
A|What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?|qw
B|Uh-huh. Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.|b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm a nurse and I work,|sd sd
A|Oh|b
B|I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that.|sd sd
A|To, to compensate for some of the benefits.|qy^d
B|Right. Uh-huh.|na ny
A|Oh.|bk
B|Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.|b sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And then I have my freedom. I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.|sd sd
A|Well, that, that's an excellent, so actually that is a benefit, uh,|ba qy^d
B|Well, it is to me. Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,|na sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I'm just really not interested in all that.|sd
A|Right. Right, well I guess that's a good point, uh,|b b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do belong to a, a large corporation or my, that where I'm currently employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation|sd sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and that got to be somewhat expensive, so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount.|sd sd
B|Yeah. Right, and especially if you have a family.|b b sv
A|Yes.|b
B|Then I think it makes a big difference.|sv
A|Yes, and that's, that's one thing I do have.|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, I don't think I would have insurance, uh, other,|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|I don't think I would go through that expense. One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours|sd sd sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.|sd
B|Right. Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?|b qy qrr
A|Well, basically, yeah I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. I mean uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I don't have that in my current operation, but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.|sd sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?|qw
B|Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so|sv
A|Yeah, yeah, that's true.|b b ba
B|I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who I am so,|sd sd sd %
A|Well, and that's an individual thing.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times|b sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,|sd
A|What do you like to watch on television ?|qw
B|Well, I guess a lot of the, uh, something that's kind of more of a comedy. We do have, uh, cable, and we have premium stations like H B O and Showtime and such, and I guess a lot of times when I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay for them|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yes|b
B|I guess I, I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there, so I don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, I tend to go to my premium channels first,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well we have cable, but we only have Cinemax, and uh, I think our favorite night is, uh, Monday night,|b b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we start out with EVENING SHADE and MAJOR DAD,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know my husband's always got it on.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm not always sitting down, and,|sd %
B|Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.|sv
A|Yes. Yes, yes. I just, I love that, all those, that two hours|aa aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, now tonight I just finished up with that A WOMAN CALLED JACKIE, did you watch did you watch it?|sd qy
B|Uh-huh. We had watched it, uh, I guess Sunday night and Monday night, but we didn't get to watch it tonight.|b na sd
A|Yeah, it, it was pretty good, it, uh, sometimes I like a dramatization, and I like, uh, U S A, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their made for T V movies|b sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and, uh, I like those. We very seldom watch any, uh, Public Television, Channel Thirteen. Do you watch it much?|sd sd qy
B|The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,|sd sv
A|Yes.|b
B|and there's a variety. Some of them is, uh, BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES, PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED? They, they rotate those around, and, um, we like that British comedy. British comedy is very fast, you really have to listen|sd qy^d sd sd sv sv
A|Yes|aa
B|but.|%
A|Now we haven't watched any of those.|sd
B|They're real good, but they do come on kind of late, but we really do enjoy those. Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.|sv sv sd sd
A|Yes, now we have watched some things on that.|b sd
B|And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there. But I'm very intrigued. I, one time I was watching an operation, and I thought, Gee, I don't believe I'm watching.|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah, we had, uh, I don't know, my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so, you know, and he's sit in front of it and, and he went by and he said, Whoops, and he backed up, and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,|b % h sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I'm saying let's move right on|sd
B|Yeah, right, right,|b b b
A|But our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, uh, animals|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|in fact, I think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and, uh, so we have watched that|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, you know, I will watch that some if I'm reading or doing something else, you know with him.|sd
B|Right. Yeah, I'm not into watching sports. Now my husband likes to watch football, he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much, but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes to watch college on Saturday, and then of course Cowboys on Sunday.|b b sv sd sd sd
A|Yes. Yes, and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside, and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine, but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,|b b sd sv sv qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around, I think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down. I don't know what channel he found that on|sd sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|and, uh, but he will turn that on, especially for, if, again, if our, uh, oldest grandson is over here. He's ten|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, I, you know, I keep telling them it's the same mentality you know, and something's wrong, and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night, because we're not home|sd sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, uh, so, and Sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on Sunday, so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos|sd sd

A|Okay, for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um, or, started to say the, uh, what causes the most air pollution is probably the car|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv % sv
B|Probably so,|ba
A|and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that or,|sv %
B|Yeah, it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.|aa sv
A|Yeah, that's exactly it, and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that,|aa ba sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.|sv sv
B|I think so too. I'm in Texas|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and very few people carpool|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job|sd
A|Exactly.|aa
B|they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.|sd

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|you're definitely right,|sv
B|That's right. And people don't want to give it up but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself|ba sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Sure, that happens quite a bit,|b b aa sd
B|but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent|sv

A|Okay.|b
B|but we're going to ignore it|ad
A|Oh, okay, we'll try to be real quick here.|aa ad
B|I'm sorry for these beeps,|fa

B|And you're in Minneapolis,|qy^d
A|Minneapolis area,|na
B|Well, is the pollution really bad up there?|qy

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural|sd sv
B|Yeah|b
A|um, but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,|% sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b
A|and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,|sd

A|at least where you .|%
B|We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas|sd
A|Sure, yeah,|b b
B|but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that|sv
A|Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Uh-huh. Sure, sure,|aa sv b b b
B|and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed|sv
A|Exactly,|aa
B|and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use|sd
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|uh, they can't use, like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed|sd
A|Uh-huh. Sure.|b b
B|and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure|b b b
B|But,|%
A|uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it|sv
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|but it's uncomfortable|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,|sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|and, I don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I was thinking how many other people|sd
B|It's probably happened to millions of people,|sv
A|oh, sure, because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars|ba sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car, and I, I thought about that, and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it|sd sd sd
B|Inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.|^2 b
A|but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that|sd
B|Yeah, well, of course in the, uh, I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,|b % sv

A|Sure.|b
B|Uh Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of,|sd

A|Look professional|sv
B|Yeah. Unfortunately.|b sv
A|Yeah, I understand. I am a, I own my company. I am in the, I am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that|b ba sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but then when I travel it is a little different situation.|sd
B|Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.|b b b b b qy
A|Yeah, I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest|b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I will always remember, I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college, my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and I sold uh, you know, manure.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that, but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|so, uh, it was sort of,|sd
B|Even the farmers.|qy^d
A|You bet even back then|na
B|Oh, wow.|bk
A|so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but here again I dress casual quite a bit so,|sd %
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, certainly.|b b ba
A|It gives you confidence. In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I wear coat and tie. If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I call on Oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie. So it depends.|sd sd

A|Uh, probably no.|nn
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|but then it depends on who you are calling on. Who you're, you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.|sd % sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.|sv
B|Right, right.|b b
A|So, it's its' just different.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Right. And, uh, I don't know, I've, I've always thought that any, uh, crime that, uh, that, uh, intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, uh, doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, you know, there's a, a very steep penalty to, uh, be paid when that's done,|b h sv

A|Uh, I believe in it, too|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm Catholic and we're not supposed to, but, uh, I feel that it, like you, you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.|sd sd % % sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|But, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know, they really didn't do it.

B|Right, exactly.|b aa
A|There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,|sv h sv

A|You know what I'm saying? Like,|qy^d %
B|Right. If, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?|b qy
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, I,|%
B|Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.|sv
A|Exactly. Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. For some reason I was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.|aa sd sd sv sv

A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.|sv
A|Uh, you know,|b
B|Get that unemployment way up so then people, you know tend towards crime, and then they they start stiffening the penalties.|sv sv sv
A|Yeah. But it's funny that, uh, I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania. I'm not even sure of that, but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that. And, it surprised, and even Florida, I know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,|b sv sv h sd % sd sv
B|Well, in Florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year. It's constantly on the,|sv %

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's like a slap on the fingers for them.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't, I don't, I don't, I think that it should be, I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?|% sv sv qy
B|I think so.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about. Although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be, they can't, I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. I don't think the parole system is really helping that much|sv % sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Reduce the violence in the prisons. I think that's its only purpose is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. Off earlier.|ad sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|But some of these guys just don't care,  you know. And so, uh,|sv %
A|I think some of them would rather be in jail|sv

A|Yeah. They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.|b sv

A|It's just, I don't, I don't know, I just|% h %
B|Uh-huh. I was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. And so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.|b sd sd sd

B|And perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.|sd sd sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|Anyways, but, uh. Yeah, we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like I said, he just, uh, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.|% sd sd sd sd
A|Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget.|sv

A|Yes. Exactly.|b ba
B|Um,|%
A|There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course, but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That,|%
B|Oh, which state is that?|qw
A|Uh, State of Minnesota.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages. I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.|sv
B|Right. Right.|b b
A|And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.|sv sd
B|Yep. Right.|b b
A|And it was just, I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,|% sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so. So it gives you idea that,|sv
B|Yeah. Definitely I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.|b ba sv
A|Sure, sure. So,|b b %
B|I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.|sv

A|Than we think. Sure. Sure.|^2 b b
B|But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.|sd
A|Uh-huh. It sure is. The, you know, as far as, I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this, and it was something more than just the conferences. They were using it as eating out, uh, when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.|b aa % sv sv sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And it's a real big crunch, uh|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course, but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them. So,|sv sv %
B|Well, that's right. Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste|ba sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.|sv
A|Sure.|b
B|I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Exactly. And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being, I mean it gave people jobs|b ba sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use. I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore.|sv sv sv
B|Right. Uh-huh.|b b

A|Well, uh, I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers, and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective. Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far. And the young people are overly impressed. And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.|sd sd sd sv sv sv
B|That's true.|ba
A|Uh, I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.|sd
B|Um, me either. I, I went to college and then started working and then got married and,|sd sd %
A|But they have, I read somewhere, and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States. Have you ever heard about that one?|% sd sd sd qy
B|No, I haven't, I know that, uh, my sister, I have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.|nn sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Uh-huh. If it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live.|ny sd
A|And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?|qy^d
B|Yeah, she only taught there one year but I,|ny sd %
A|But she got credits for it?|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|That's very interesting.|ba
B|And, um, I think it would be, I know that also one of my cousins who, uh, he is in like the therapy type thing and he was, um, some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh, I mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.|% sd % sd sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So, you know, if, I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.|% sv
A|Yeah, I think that is an excellent program, I really do. I like that. And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.|aa sv sv sd sv
B|Yeah. As far as yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff, yeah.|b ^2
A|Right, you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,|aa sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but we could find one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I, I can see the advantage to that one. The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?|sd qy
B|I really don't know that much about it, you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when,|sd sd
A|It's still in existence.|sd
B|Yeah. And don't they go into other countries and stuff?|b qy
A|I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, uh, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.|na
B|Uh-huh. Things that make the, yeah. Make them more self-supporting?|b % b qy^d
A|Yes. They,|ny %
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.|sv
B|Right. Yeah.|b b
A|And, yes, you're right, I think it's a sixties program. I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he, that was his big deal.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv sd sd sd
B|But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.|sv
A|Right. Right. Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,|b b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But there's a,|%
B|I don't, I don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,|sd
A|Mandatory just like, like the draft. No.|^2 aa
B|I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,|sd
A|Every time you, They could buy their way out.|^2 sv
B|Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else|aa sv
A|Right, you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. Can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good.|b sv sd sv % sd sv qy sd sv qy sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know that it does. I, I, don't know that, um, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, we're losing certain, races of people.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out. There's a German word for it that's elegant, but I never can remember what it was, uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.|sv sd sd sd
B|Right, yeah.|b b
A|Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.|sd
B|Yeah, uh-huh.|b b
A|Uh, when we were in Australia, uh, sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore, and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad.|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people, and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is, really an effective tool.|sv
B|Well, Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.|% sd
A|Good point. We've got enough without without a passport there's plenty.|ba sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yes. I think we ought to worry about our own species.|b sv
B|And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.|sv
A|I wonder now in, and I've been out of school too long to answer this, but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.|% sd sd
B|There probably are, you know, for but I'm sure, that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know, and I'm not saying just give them money but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be,|sv % sv sv sv % sd sd
A|That's the last thing you want, to do.|sv
B|Yeah I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money or, what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people, I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,|b sv ^h sd sv
A|Yeah, that's exactly it.|aa sv
B|but.|%
A|They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it. Now come on, let's be realistic,|sv ad
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's just not realistic.|sv
B|Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,|^2
A|Right.|aa
B|I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here, but.|sv %
A|No, we're not I don't think. I think, that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps.|ar sv sv
B|Yeah, I mean it's, True. Yeah.|b % ba b
A|I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, we've got plenty, in fact, we've got far too many. You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?|sv sv qy
B|Flower Mound, yeah. So, we're a little you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.|na ny sd
A|I was, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. Have you ever, have, have you been downtown|% sd qy
A|Well I haven't had an awful lot of, uh, incidents regarding child care. When my two year old was in New Orleans, she got bit on the cheek and, uh, but, uh, that's about the, the, uh, the extent of it. But, but, but when, I really am, am concerned about is that, uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, uh, uh, you know, investigation for, for, uh, you know, child molestation.|sd sd sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I, and I, and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your, your, your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place and they don't pay very much and why, why would they be interested in, in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.|sv sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother I have three children and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young, I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.|b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So I, I, I, you know, it is a problem. And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford. When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.|% sv sv sv sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.|sd sd sd sd
A|Oh, well that's interesting.|ba
B|But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune. I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.|sd sd
A|Oh, my God.|ba

A|Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.|sv

B|And, and I felt, uh, very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually.|sd sd

A|Well, not, not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. I'm an engineer.|ar sd sd
B|Oh. Well|%
A|And,|%
B|I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh, I'm with the university actually|sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful, they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So that, that sort of an, most of the teachers had degrees. Uh,|% sd
A|Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.|sd

A|That's incredible.|sv
B|It was incredible actually|aa
A|Oh, oh.|b

A|Well.|%
B|I mean they really had some great opportunities. But, what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,|sd % sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.|sv
A|You know, they could, somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know, that's a good starting wage|% % sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.|sv
B|Uh-huh. No, even that, that really, I think, I don't, it's been awhile since I've looked at, my youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers. But they are|b aa % sd sd sd %
A|Huh.|b
B|you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?|qy^d
B|Something like that.|na
A|Oh my.|ba
B|Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children. I mean it has been a real, uh, there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think, I think they have captured a certain market. Again the, but then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.|sd % sv sv % sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
A|Well, since you live close, I don't know if you know, um, about what Louisville is doing with recycling, or are you familiar with any of that?|sd qy
B|Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, like the area in there,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.|sd
A|Yeah. You know, I read, you know, when they first started doing that in the paper, and I read about that, I was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time. And, you know, we separate everything out, and then have to haul it up to a Metco , you know, which is a real pain.|b % sd sd sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|So if they would come up, curbside recycling,|sd
B|they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.|^2
A|Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Oh, God.|ba

A|And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great. And we started taking them up there. And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know I didn't know. And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|That's really nice to find out that it's behind there Well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers. I couldn't even think of what you call them.|sd sd sd

A|And really, that's about, that's really about it. Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?|sd qy
B|Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.|na
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,|sd
A|I know.|ba
B|I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.|sd
A|I know. I know. We're kind of the same way. You know, at first, you know, you, at first it was a real, it was a real hassle, and I'm wondering are we really going to do this, but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,|ba ba sd % sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know. So I just go, you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there, you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,|% sd sd sd

B|Those milk cartons take up so much room.|sd

B|We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.|sd sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|Some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing.

A|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Well, I, I don't think that it's, it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions. For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives.|sd sd
B|Uh, I agree with that. People that are, uh, driving like, uh, truck drivers and things like that.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I definitely think they should be tested. And I'm not, I'm not opposed to any testing. I mean because I know I certainly wouldn't want to, to, uh, you know, be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh ...|%
A|Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?|qo
B|Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company. I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States. It's, uh, it's okay. I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. I think they could, uh, save money by not doing that. You know, every time, say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.|sd sd
A|Well, what about random testing, though.|qw^d
B|Oh.|b
A|Do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?|qy
B|Uh, not if it's done fairly. And that's probably my question is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.|ng sd
A|I don't know that you do. If it's random, then it's random|sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that's not necessarily fair.|sv
B|Well, they might tell you it's random.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery. Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries. You know.|sv sv
A|Yeah. Well, I I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test and it's not random.|b sd sd
B|Oh, I see. How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?|b qw
A|Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.|sd sd
B|Oh, I see. So, do you ...|bk %
A|And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.|sd
B|Right. Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place. You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.|b qy qy
A|Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally|na
B|Right.|b
A|but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently|sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|and their manager assumes they have a drug problem I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.|sv sv
B|Right, right. Yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...|b b b %
A|It's an accusation, and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.|b qh
A|Right, exactly. I, I don't, the, I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.|b aa % sv
B|Right. I agree with that. Because I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years, it will be three years in August and I've already been drug tested three times.|b aa sd sd sd

B|Well, I'm an environmental engineer|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|That is odd. I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well, the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company|ba sd sd sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.|sd

A|Okay. So, uh, Mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qo
B|Well I work for an insurance company so I see a lot of, uh, verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. Um, by juries particularly, and I know in England the judges set all of the awards. You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence, but then they leave the awards up to more learned people. And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars|^h sd sd sd sd sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. That, that seems to make sense but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, uh, kind of the rate for different .|b b sv bf
B|Oh, exactly. Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|When you get one way out like that but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after. Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|You know, they're not going to sit there and lose money. If they are losing money, then they're going to raise rates.|sv sd
A|Right. they|b %
B|So it all comes filtering down to us all individually.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged,  you know.|sv
A|Well,  how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?|qo qy
B|I don't know. You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it pre specified in the policy so much but I don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value on somebody's limb,  uh, arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.|no sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with, with that. I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old.|sv sv
A|Huh.|b
B|I, I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that can be part of continuing education, maybe for judges|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know.|h
A|Right.|b
B|You know, to get into the economics of things, uh, because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards,  it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.|sd sv
A|Yeah. That's true.|b ba
B|If it's a company, you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|I think those should be uninsurable. I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that,  that did the damage.|sv sv
A|Oh, out of As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,|bf bf
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|Uh-huh. Well, we're,  Who, who|b %
B|For, for honest mistakes where they've done something and, and something happens. One of their employees causes damage or something. Sure. That's what they buy insurance for.|sd sd sv
A|do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work?|qy qw
B|Well, I was just talking about any company. Uh,  let's just say a lumber manufacturing company|sd ad
A|Oh, okay, your talking about|bk bf
B|and,  uh, somebody is on the premises|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures,  them.|sd sd sd sd
A|Okay. Well,|b %
B|Sure. Insurance should pay for that.|sv sv
A|But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.|sv
B|Well I'm not talking about any loss. I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. But it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their,  negligence.   For gross wanton negligence in a claim.|ar sd sd sd
A|That, For, oh, Uh-huh.|% % b
B|And unfortunately the the, lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.|% sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So again, it never really penalizes,  the company doing the wrong.|sv
A|Right. That will,|b %
B|They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|And if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know, I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences, I'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know, maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.|sv sd sd sv sv

A|You spend what you have and, Yeah, I think that, the general idea is to you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy, but they're running under the you know, the way they're running it now, they're you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession, so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running, so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt, you're not going to payoff what you owe, but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay you know, get what you pay for.|^2 % b sv sv sv sv sv sv sd

A|Uh-huh. I agree with that.|b ba
B|But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.|sv
A|I guess, I'm, I'm a student right now and I don't make a whole lot of money and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.

B|We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.|sd sv

B|But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.|sv

A|Right. And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?|b qw
B|Um, well, the, see, uh, well, we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list|% sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
B|right, we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. Or but naturally, no, it was even Mennonite related, I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.|aa sd % ar sd sd sd

B|Uh, what do you think?|qo
A|My grandmother lived with us, um, until August, um, and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home. She has leukemia|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home, and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility. She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set|sd sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|so.|%
B|yeah, that's important I would say.|b ba
A|Yes. And that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two, so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room|aa sd sd
B|Okay.|b
A|so she didn't have to be transported back and forth. So, she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well. It's not her favorite place to be in. She'd much rather be here with me. But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her,|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I've got little children here who needed me here she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.|sd sd
B|Right, and that becomes difficult then.|aa sv
A|So. She was falling down and hemorrhaging and, you know, all kinds of physical problems, so it just became too much for me to handle, even though I would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore.|% sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yep, we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life, but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could|b aa sd sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b b
B|but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and this, eventually things just went too far|% sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.|sd
A|Yes, well, I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age, other people have to kind of help them make decisions. It sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home, but she's accepted it real well now|b sv sd sd
B|Right|b
A|so.|%
B|well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.|sv
A|Well, we enjoyed having her here,|sd
B|And.|%
A|but we feel she's much safer where she is now. She still continues to fall, but when she does there, a nurse is right there to help her|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know she's eating the right things, and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her, so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair|sd sd sd
B|Yep.|b
A|so, I think she'll adjust,|sd
B|Let's see, *something missing? A.1? my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing, but, I, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,|^h sd sd

A|I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course we water a little bit, that's just too much to water all at once, but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.|sd sd sd sd

B|Oh, that sounds lovely. Uh-huh. Oh, the wild flowers are beautiful. I think, um, I was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.

Um, I've just never really, you know, maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow, but, um, my husband takes it on, and I'll help rake up the grass, and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um, because, we don't have that much property, but we're on a corner lot, so there's a lot of edging to do|b sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|and the way I was brought up, and he wants me now, he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now|sd sd sd
A|Best friends, now.|b^m
B|and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, and it's always the same man|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best friends|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. It's like, you know, I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know|sd sd sd ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together, and you know, his kids are, you know, when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach, and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know|sd sd % sd sd

A|And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.|sd sd
B|Yeah, yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, what I'll do is, you know, like, I mean, you might have problems, but it's not your kids' problems you know,|b b % % % sv sv
A|Yeah, oh, yeah.|aa aa
B|and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to, you know, like, thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know,|sv % sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know, and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.|sv sv sv sv

B|Right.|b
A|And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.|sv
B|Right. Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, yeah, a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.|b sd % sd sd

B|He,|%

B|It is, and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, uh, built|aa sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.|sd
A|Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're kind of rare.|sd
B|So we put a three car garage in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. All of it was taken up with just car space.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.|b % sd sd

B|Uh-huh. Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.|b ba
A|It really is.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,|sv % sd

B|And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. His parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, I still, all three of my daughters are married, but, I don't know, I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.|b % sd h sd
B|Right. Oh, I understand|aa aa

A|That's right, you sure don't. At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.|aa aa sd
B|Well, I I haven't reached that point yet. I've heard people say that. But, uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|He's out of college and has a good job,|sd

B|Oh, ho-ho.|ba
A|And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.|sd
B|A whole new world. Uh-huh.|ba b
A|And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses|sd

A|I I never did put things up when my kids were little and I haven't with them. I try to teach them not to get into things.|sd sd sd
B|Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.|sd sd
A|I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. So it's worked pretty well. There's, I don't really think anything's been broken. Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.|sv sd sd sd % sd sd

A|My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that, well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.|sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, was realistic.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh, that God because, *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.|sd
B|Really. That was smart. Yeah.|aa ba b
A|And, uh, what we did was just, uh, decide how we had been spending our money before,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and, uh, and adjusted,  where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,|sd sd
B|Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.|sd
B|Wow, that's great.|ba

B|Did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of,|qy qy
A|Oh, just our own design.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Gosh.|ba
A|And the, so, but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, uh, you know, of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked|% sd % sd
B|Yeah|b
A|We spent too much money,  until our children went to college, so. So, tell me about,|sd ad
B|Yeah.|b
A|do you all, uh, have a budget?|qy
B|Well, we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict but, budget but, uh, the about and to our, when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just, you know, dirt poor. Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. So, we virtually did that for about two years,  which worked real well, and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved,  and moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,|sd sd % % % sd sd sd sd
A|Wonderful. Yes.|ba aa
B|so, I don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live. Um, so, now, since, uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, um,|sd sd sd
A|Three and a two year old.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Bang, *one utt?? bang.|ba ba
B|That's, that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too. An we, um, have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids. And, um, we just really have, uh, I don't know, we, we've tried different times, we've done like a survey of like taking, you know, the past three months of where all the money went.|sd sd sd h sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all, but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing something, you know.|sd sd
A|Well, I think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though, you have to do something.|sv sv
B|Yeah, that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids, we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're JORDACHE new or whether they're *listen; "because" may start new utt unit  you know, something|b sv sv sd sd sd
A|Of course not.|aa
B|and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes, so. But, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, that are more, you know, nonessential items.|sd sd sd
A|Well, I found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned,  but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish,  gifts as,  we had done before.|sd
B|Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.|sv
B|On your friends, that's true, that's true. Well, we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with, we both have older cars and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars, you know, on the car in two months or something,|aa aa aa sd sd sd
A|Yes.|aa
B|and, you know, a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for. And, uh,|sv %

A|Exactly, although so much per month anyway.|aa sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|And, uh, that really should be in your but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month|sv sv
B|Yeah our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to, let's see, now, I forget which way we do it. We don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,|b sd ^h sd sd sd

A|Uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.|sv
B|Yeah, because we don't miss it, we really don't, when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff, so. But we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the, uh, expenses for college already, you know, eighteen years away or whatever.|aa sd sd sd

A|So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.|sd

A|My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.|sd

A|Yeah, can you believe it, that's just, uh,|ny qh %
B|I'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something|^h sd
A|Taco Bueno, right, uh-huh.|sd aa b
B|and he just shot them himself and her.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b aa
B|I remember seeing that.|sd
A|Yeah, uh, uh, isn't that weird?|b qy
B|Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.|ny sv
A|I know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. You know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything.|aa sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids|sd
A|So you have a child Uh-huh.|qy^d
B|Yeah we, Two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh, finding what we consider to be, real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think.|ny % na sd
A|Uh,|%
B|How about you, do you have any children?|qo qy
A|Yes, our first and he just turned three months.|ny sd sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|So, we're just starting into hunting for child care.|sd

A|Right now, both of us are students.|sd
B|Are you? Where are a student?|bh qw
A|Uh, Uh, University of Southern Mississippi.|% sd
B|No kidding.|ba
A|Uh, she's,|%
B|I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?|% qy
A|Uh, probably. Uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs|na sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. Right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. Uh, I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|So for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.|sd
B|Well, that's a good experience, I think, and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good and they kind of boil down to, uh, any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative|ba sv sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, that's more important than anything else. We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, she goes to a home. This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They've been here probably thirty, forty years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|They've got three daughters. Uh, and, they have a loving home and, uh, they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so it's a good experience.|sd
A|Uh, that makes a big difference.|ba
B|I if it's good, I think it's very good for the child.|% sd sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good and, and that's really what we've learned about it. She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year|sv sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, we feel real fortunate and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace. I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg.|sd sd qw^d
A|There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department|sd
B|Yeah. I'll bet they're involved. Yeah.|b ba b
A|uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So,|%
B|Well, that's, uh, I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry|sv sv
A|Yeah. Yeah,|b
B|and I think this is really  is buyer beware.  Well, it is the best way  to do it, interestingly.|sv
A|a cottage industry's the best way to do it really, because if you over,|sv %
B|I think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.|b b b
B|Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.|sv

A|You want to go first?|qy
B|No, you can start|nn sd
A|Okay. Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.|sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|you know what I mean?|qy
B|Right. There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh|na sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|there, there's no way. We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.|sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.|sv
A|That's it.|aa
B|Uh, every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.|sd sv
A|Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question|sd sd sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know, all these things. I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.|sd sd sv
B|Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal.|aa bf
A|And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.|sd
B|Yep.|b
A|I, I think this is a little ridiculous.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.|sv
B|Oh, that's right. I work for a law firm|aa sd
A|I, I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.|sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, if someone is|%
B|Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.|sd
A|Well.|b
B|Plea bargaining is something completely different. That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up.|sv sv
A|Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly but  you know, they get lesser sentences|aa sd sv sd h sv
B|Right.|b
A|and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.|sv
B|Huh.|%
A|you know what I'm saying? That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.|qy sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh I, I think they should.|sv
B|We do|sd
A|I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people and, uh, you know, all|sv %
B|Right.|b
A|they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.|sd sv sv
B|Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned.|b sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We just have the case, I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry.|sd qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up|sd

A|It, uh, Yeah.|% b
B|But, uh, that was absurd There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.|sv sv
A|I know that, that Uh-huh. And, I don't know. Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?|% b h qw
B|Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd. There's no way that could work.|% sd sv sv

B|Uh, but,|%

B|No one would want the job|sv
A|No. Not really.|aa aa
B|Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.|sd
A|Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,|qy
B|Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury. That, that, that right|ny sv %
A|I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.|sd
B|Well, I mean, were there witnesses?|qy
A|In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.|bf
B|Right. Right. That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.|aa aa bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances|sv
A|Well, I, I,|%
B|So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?|sv sd qo qy
A|Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line. Devil's advocate possibly, but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law, you're still circumventing it. You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.|ng h sv sd sd
B|What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?|qw qw
A|Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument. I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Um, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. Uh, but then why not pay, pay the sales tax Corporations have to, why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?|sv sv sd qh sd qh
B|Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.|sv sd
A|Yes.|b
B|Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So I go outside the area for that. And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state. I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.|sv sd sv sv
A|I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get. With some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?|aa qh sd sd sv qy
B|Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.|no sv ^q
A|Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.|sd
B|Right. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden  shouldn't be placed on the consumer.|aa sv sd sv sv
A|And I, I  I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.|qy
A|No. Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah. Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My accounting department will at the end of the month. I think that I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C.|nn sd sd sd sd sv sd
B|Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business.|b sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.|sd sv
A|That's true. a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that. There, there is no well defined mechanism at all and, and that it is a a loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that. But it, but,|aa sv sd sv sd %
A|Okay, so, what are, what are your views on capital punishment?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qo
B|I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is. But, on the other hand, it is very, very expensive to maintain, you know, Texas has one of biggest criminal justice systems in the country.|sd sv sd
A|Yes.|aa
B|And it's eating us alive budget wise and, uh,|sd %
A|So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?|qy
B|Yes, we do practice capital punishment, but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.|ny sd sd
A|Yes, that's similar to Georgia.|b sd
B|Yeah. And then, I was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because I had forgotten, I guess, that I wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.|b sd
A|That's probably true considering, Yes. Yes, uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,|sv b b sv
B|Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it.|sv
A|Yes. Right, that would be the intent of it.|aa aa sv
B|Yeah, but I'm not sure how successful that is.|b sv
A|Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals.|sv
B|Quicker  maybe, yeah.|bf b
A|Yeah, if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,|aa sv
B|Uh-huh. What, what kind of work do you do?|b qw

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids, we'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road, you know.|sv sv
A|Um, that's probably true, but I guess there's other factors that,|aa sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,|sv
B|Well I'm not talking about just in the school system.|sd
A|but it's not going to, Oh, I see.|sv b
B|See, I'm talking about, like, in, in, uh, I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared.

B|Five hundred of them are good, solid kids and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.|sd sd

A|So that's a difficult situation.|ba
B|And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road. Now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment, but some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing,|sd sv sd
A|Um.|%
B|and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals, and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system, I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.|sv sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh, and some of them are our problems, but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do.|sv sv sv

B|Oh, okay. Right. Uh,|b b
A|Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.|sv

A|I don't know. What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?|h qw
B|Well those and probably the security aspect of it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated, and it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.|sd h sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off.|sv qh sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh, I think the company still exists. What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like, unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth. You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits. So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.|sv sv sd sd sd sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know. I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.|sv sv
A|Now how do you mean that? I know it,|qo %
B|Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh, for the bad times of the company.|qw^d

B|What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.|qw^d
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.|h
A|Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.|b sd sd sd

B|Okay Uh, I've, the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also. And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta.|na % sd sv sv
A|Yeah. Yeah. was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?|b b qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Yes. That, that was true for mine too. Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.|b sd sv sv sv
B|What|qw
A|And, uh  you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.|sv
B|Yeah, that's true.|aa aa
A|I mean  know|%
B|Yeah. And I'm also I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know, in areas where they|b % sv
A|Yeah, that's true. But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,|aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true.|b aa aa
A|now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really, I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.|sd sv % sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But these people obviously weren't.|sd
B|That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow, well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area but I still, I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, you know.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region|sv
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.|sv
A|Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,|aa sv sv
B|So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn and,|sv %
A|Yeah. And, again, I don't, I mean got know the, you know, how qualified, I mean, I think it'd be interesting to, you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school.

B|Yeah. I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.|b sd

A|you want to, Yeah. They'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters and then, I think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so that will probably help out.|b^m aa sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary I'd, you know, I, Yeah, we, we do. We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.|b b b b sd % ny sd sd

A|But there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. that's about, five percent right there|sd

A|I have, so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,  or so.|sd

A|Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.|sd
B|Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.|sv
A|Well, it's not too new.|aa
B|Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?|b qw
A|Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.|sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print|sd sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away.|sd sd sd
B|Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.|b sv sd sd sd
A|Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation|sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.|sv
B|Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet|aa sv sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.|sv sd sd
A|And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.|sv sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.|sd sd
B|Huh.|%
A|So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.|sd
B|Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?|sd sv sd qw
A|Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.|b sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|He just said burn it.|sd
B|Okay|b
A|He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical|sd sv

I don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, I might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it. And, uh, how about you|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd % sd sv sv sv sv sv qo
B|Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted.|sv
A|Uh-huh, I do, too, yep.|aa aa aa

A|Uh-huh, yeah, you still have to do it. I, I,|aa aa sd %
B|I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or,|%
A|So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.|bf
B|Well, for some things.|aap_am
A|Right.|b
B|I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society.|b b sv
B|I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.|sv
A|Right. And then do it all over again. Uh-huh.|b ^2 b
B|And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.|sv
A|Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it I just, I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh,|aa aa sd sv sd sv sv sv
B|But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, uh-huh.|b b b b
B|and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.|sv
A|Uh-huh, huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.|b qy sv qy^d
B|Uh it is to a certain extent|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I think, I don't know because,|sv h
A|I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. Uh,|sd
B|I think in and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment.|b b b b sd sd sd sd sd sd sv

A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society.|sv

B|Huh. Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.|% sd
A|Uh-huh, wow, yeah.|b ba b
B|And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes and I'll put in there, and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person but I like it, it adds something to the chicken.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|And then just bake it, and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.|sd sd

A|or, you know semi .|sv
B|But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.|qy^d
A|Yeah. You put in, um|ny sd
B|Um.|%
A|let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice or,|sd %
B|Um.|%
A|It depends on, you can really vary it.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.|sd h sd
B|Yeah, yeah, I, I use that for for rice and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.|b b sd sd
A|Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.|b ^2 b b
B|Um. Now that would be good.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|How long do you have to bake it?|qw

B|How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?|qw
A|Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.|sd % sd
B|Oh, okay. Okay. Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored|bk b qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|or do you go ahead and let it cook through?|qrr
A|Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.|sd
B|Um. Ooh, this is a beneficial call. I like this|% sv sd
A|Yeah, I liked your idea too, there.|aa sd

A|And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem. Uh, in Dallas, some of the major problems, uh, drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now. There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh, people trying to get money for drugs.|sd sd sd sd

A|And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah, it's, it's really, it's, and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or, or or Chapel Hill.|aa % sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever. I mean, it's kind of, I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it, but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst. They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Really?|bh
B|And over half of it has been drug related.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, Dallas is having quite a few. Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related. Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.|sd sd sv sv

B|Yeah.|b

B|Uh, I don't, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,|sv

A|But, if there are some people who don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.|sv

B|Huh. Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.|sv sv sv sv sv % sv

A|And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that, if I were let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.|sv sv sv sv sd

B|Yeah. I, uh, I don't know, I think the, I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system|b h sv
A|Yeah, well, I I, I don't know, I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know,|b h sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury,  a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that's hard to say. Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.|h sv ^q
B|Right.|b
A|And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I, I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. Let's, let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.|sv h sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, not, I, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury, but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be,  things like that.|% % sv sd

A|Oh.|b
B|My husband is a physician, so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot. But children, I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.|sd sd % sv
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I really believe that. And it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age, and I think our kids are real secure.

B|Some baby-sitting groups, again, I know it sounds like a rationalization, but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they, they learn to share. They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.|sd sd sv sv sv

A|Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.|sv
B|Uh, I certainly can't argue with that. Definitely does need some improvements. Uh, and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to.|aa sv sv
A|Yeah, I think there's a limit on that. The, uh, the, uh peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many,|aa sv sd
B|I think it's, Four or five,|sd

B|I can't remember which. I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got.|h sd sd
A|Um. Yeah, it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things. I think I have a severe demeanor or something.|b sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|Uh,|%
B|That, uh,|%
A|But, typically, you know, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.|sv sv
B|Right, but it still has to be a group of your peers.|aa sv
A|Right.|b
B|See.|%
A|So,|%
B|So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,|sd
A|So if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have nincompoops to, uh,|sv
B|You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat, but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.|sv sv
A|Um.|%
B|I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right|sv qy
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|ny ny
B|and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.|sd sv
A|Um.|%
B|Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.  Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.|sv
A|Well, I suppose you may be right on that. Matter of fact, I've heard that,  I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,|aap_am sd
B|Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. But when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side, and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.|bh sd %
B|At least in California, they're supposed to be. Not during the trial, during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background.|sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. They get too boring.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh. So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.|b bf
B|Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant, you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.|bf sd sv
A|What about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.|qo

A|Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes, and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government|sv sv sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.|sv

B|That's correct.|aa
A|I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and, and then force upon them, uh,|sv

A|Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers', uh, recent, uh, piece for, uh, Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful. But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are, are seeing their real incomes, and thus, standards of living, decline. And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve. That's not a formula for a better society.|sd fo_o_fw_"_by_bc fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sv sd sd sd sv

A|I mean, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful|ar
B|Right, the, yeah|b % %
A|You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting. But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair, and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it. I I'll tell you one quick, uh, one thing very interesting. C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.|sv sv sv sv sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They expect, opening it for one hour, that they'll get three, hundred thousand telephone calls.|sd
B|I'm sure they will.|sv
A|And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and, and vent their frustration with government. Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that. You know, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|I think that's coming and I think once, once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change. Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful. So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved, and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.|sv sv sv qh sv sv
B|Yes, I understand that, but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.|b sd sd
A|Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and, and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems. So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.|sv sv

A|and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest.

But a lot of parents would not take the time, you know, and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and I are, and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it, they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something.

They would let you use it maybe once a year. You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but, um, I have seen so many people and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen.

I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know, I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that.

B|Yeah, I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation and that, we think we need all these things and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know, like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't, you know, do without too much and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time. You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,  you know, going in one big swoop, save up and then buy it.|b sv % sv sv sv sd sd sd sd sv sv sv sv

A|Detroit?|br
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?|qy
B|Well, it wasn't really. It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.|ng sd
A|Right, okay.|bk bk
B|And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.|sd
A|Right. So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?|b qy^d
B|No. The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.|nn sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|And that was real nice. Uh,|sv
A|Did you scuba dive there?|qy
B|No, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.|nn sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.|b sd
A|Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.|ba b b ba
B|Huh.|b
A|I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.|b b ba
A|So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long|sd sd sd
B|Oh, well, that's nice. Yeah.|ba b
A|Worked at a camp there, and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.|sd sd sd
B|Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, and that's canoeing.|sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.|sd sd sd
A|That's nice. We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.|ba sd
B|It's a whole new, Uh-huh.|sd b
A|And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,|sv sd % sd sd sd sd sd
B|Sure. Uh-huh.|b b

B|Oh, that's neat. Sure.|ba b
A|and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was like,|sv
B|Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too, and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,|sv sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do|sv
A|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
B|so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And you're more receptive.|sv
A|Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.|ba ^h sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to England a few years ago.|sd
B|Oh, that's exciting.|ba
A|I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.|sd sd % sd sv sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.|b sd sd sd sd
A|It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,|sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,|sd
B|Do your own thing. Yeah.|^2 b
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.|sd

A|Yeah, I know,|b ba
B|I'll say .|ba

A|Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.|b sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.|sd sd
B|Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around.|aa aa b bf
A|So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,|aa sd sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh. That's great.|b ba
A|So we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in and got seated, and then no one knew English in there, and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.|sd sd sd sd

A|so, It was, it was a pleasant time.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
A|I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.|sd sd sv
B|I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.|sv

A|Uh, I guess my feelings are that, uh, we almost have a universal health care system, uh, to a great degree, except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people.|sv
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people, because I'm sure that some of them don't, uh, don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves, so, uh, I, I have a feeling, since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get, that this, uh, then becomes an obligation of the government, because it's going to become an obligation of either state, local or federal government, anyway.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah, because when people can't pay, they end up going to clinics or, you know, to public hospitals, and that kind of thing, and, you know,|b sv %
A|Well, it seems to me that, that I'm paying anyway, because when I go, or my insurance carrier, anyway, when I pay something, the bills seem inordinately high.|sv
B|Oh, definitely.|aa
A|And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.|sv
B|Right. Yeah, yeah.|b b b
A|It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.|sv
B|Yeah. Yeah, yeah.|b b b
A|And myself, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government, I don't know|b sv sd h
A|Well   well, who, who else is going to do this, then?|qw
B|Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then? Yeah, yeah.|qh b b
A|I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've heard all these stories about, I travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in Europe every year,|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and I find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people I talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity, and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|As a matter of fact, if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm, say in Germany or France, uh, that, I'm automatically taken care of,|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|I mean I don't even have to pay.|sd
B|Yeah. Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures People, um, you know, just go on and on and on. I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care or, and it just extends with if it, what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous, you know, burden on the taxpayers. They're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.|b sv sv sv sv fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|and the extraordinary amounts, I know that, because those people vote, I mean, they're the ones who get out and vote, that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, I think,|sv sd sd sv sv sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b
A|and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.|sv

A|Huh.|b
B|They, on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles, they used to have a, or, I guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected, he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything, he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, And had ended up,|% sd sd sv sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Well, that is interesting. Right.|ba b
B|So, it's pretty interesting work so,|sv %
A|That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.|sv
B|Yeah, it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard you have to plod through it and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,|b sv sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.|sd
A|And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.|sd
B|No, I have not seen it. But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,|aa sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh, it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have. I am sort of rereading it. It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle, but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian, he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know, he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh. Explained , *listen; could be br|% sd
B|and, you know. Uh, and the reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen. And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's, uh, Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two, and they were, they were lost and, uh,|sd sd % sd sd %
A|Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.|qy^d
B|Yeah, they were.|ny sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so, and in the book, you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth. And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.|sd sd sd sd sv
A|Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?|b qy

A|and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie|sv

B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|So, um, do you want to discuss the recipe?|qy
B|Well,|arp_nd
A|I have a recipe if you want|oo_co_cc
B|Okay, sure,|aa aa
A|Um, it filled , a lot of people try to stay away from this but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding.|% sv sd
B|Is that right? I've never heard of that.|bh sd
A|Yeah, it, and it if you, um, well, first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat.|ny % sd sd ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it, it ends up burning, I mean, no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.|ad sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't let that worry me. And I get the milk lukewarm and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and I have this thing it's called the slender blender, it, it makes the, uh, it makes, uh, a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough. It's, uh, I don't know, they're called moo goo leaves or something they're|sd sd sd sd sd sd h sd %
B|I think I know what you're is it like a hand held?|sv qy
A|Yeah. They're real neat.|ny sv
B|The, yeah, okay.|% bk bk
A|I think they're real reasonably priced, some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I didn't get that one, I got the Black and Decker kind. But, uh, it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the the milk, you know, and it does an excellent job, or just hand beat it. I guess you could use a hand mixer but I don't think it I don't think it gets it good enough.|sv sd sd sd sd sv ad sv sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh. Huh.|b
A|And then before the milk gets too hot, um, I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good. And then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much, I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's, it starts thickening, when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little, I don't know, it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch, and you just keep beating it in. And it's the, the trick is, is to have this blender, so, if you were, you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time, it's, you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened I cook it for a good, once it starts boiling, I just, I cook it for a good seven minutes, seven to ten minutes|sd sd sd sd sd sd ad % sd % sv sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put, um, really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla, um, custard. Yeah,|sd sd sd sd %
B|Oh, wow. That is really interesting. Are you saying to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,|ba sv br
A|A chocolate powder.|sd
B|unsweetened?|br
A|Yeah, that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened. It comes in like a real dark can,|ny sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|our mothers used to use it. And then,|sd %

B|I just want to,|sd
A|yeah , it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestles Quik.|b sd sd
B|Right. Okay.|b bk
A|I suppose you could use that.|sv
B|Cooking chocolate.|bf
A|Yeah, but, um,|ny %
B|That's really interesting, I've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat.|sv sd
A|Well, I used to make the regular pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day, where you cut the pie, it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red, and I'm like, oh, this is kind of groedy .|sd sd sd sd ^q
B|Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?|qw
A|Um, actually I found it in one of my mother's, um, homemade cookbooks, I mean, something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.|sd sd
B|Is that right? Oh, neat,|bh ba
A|So,|%
B|that is just really neat. Because I,|sv %
A|I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater but, um,|sv %
B|It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.|bf
A|Yeah, but I still think a beater would do it good enough, um, the trick is to get the cornstarch,|ny sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, yeah , right in the, in the lukewarm milk. Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good. It seems to be better than putting the, the cornstarch into the liquid it, once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.|% sd sd sd sd sv sd
B|So you put the milk in the cornstarch?|qy^d
A|Yeah. And I'll do this, uh, sometimes I'll put my after I pour that into my, back into my saucepan. I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg. So,|ny sd sd sd %
B|And then put that back in the saucepan?|qy^d
A|Yep. And then, you know, if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to. The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more.|ny sd
B|Huh that's,|%
A|Because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the, sometimes the cocoa is like, my husband really likes it thick he says, I can stick the spoon right in this.|sd % sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know, when you cook a package, it's, it's a little less,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I put it in a nice glass bowl and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding so you can put, uh, Saran Wrap over the top.|sd sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap, so, when you pull the Saran Wrap back, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and I might put it back on. But, um,|sd sd sd %
B|Do do you put it in the refrigerator then or|qy %
A|Yeah, after, well when it starts steaming a lot, uh, I definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,|ny sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, um, I, my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.|% sd
B|Right, that's true. I knew that.|b sv sd
A|That's , yeah,|% b
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, that's why I do that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, well, I don't know that's my, my great hard recipe.|h sd
A|We're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process.|sd qy^d
B|Well, not so much personally but my, um, husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother, I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such. They live down in College Station where, his parents do too. And they put her in a home last year.|ng sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to, uh, not be able to be in her apartment on her own.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So they found a, a place nearby that they put her in last year.|sd
A|So it was pretty much a physical decision?|qy^d
B|Uh, yeah, although she is, uh, in pretty good health and she's, doesn't take any medication, it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.|ny sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|Then she was starting to get, uh, you know, lose memory sometimes and, which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh,|%
A|My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult. Was she in favor of it or, or was she kind of opposed to it?|sd sv qy qrr
B|Well, yeah, when it finally came down to it, um, she just got to the point after the, I mean, it wasn't a very, um, strong stroke. It was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore.|ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she got kind of fearful of being on her own. She never really ate very well. It was one thing. She hardly  ever took care of herself|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and she didn't eat. She ate very poor so I think she was, you know, bad, uh, nutrition on top of it. And, uh, she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore. So,|sd sd sd sd %
A|So often I think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad. I work with a lot of elderly people, I'm a trust officer|sv sd sd
B|Um.|%
A|and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.|sd
B|Well, she was almost ridiculous. Like she'd eat ice cream and cookies. She'd,|sd sd sd
A|Yes. Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.|aa sd

A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|ny ny
B|Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that's too much trouble. That's too much trouble. Didn't want to cook.|^q ^q sd
A|And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals. I do that right now,|sd sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I'm not near nursing home age.|sd
B|Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels,  Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat.|sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.|b b qy^d qrr
B|No, I don't think there was. Um, I know a little bit more from a, a co-worker. Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.|nn sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care. Uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory so they  were almost, you know, to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I remember from her checking around, she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh, a, uh, bathroom. All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items|sd
A|Oh yeah. That's a given.|aa sv
B|They're always saying that somebody's going to, and some of them, I think unconsciously do it, you know,  as a just, you know, half|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. And sometimes the, the help there does it, I think.|b sv
B|Uh So, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. Very limited space waste|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room  and, and eat some good meals.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but,|sd sv %
A|Adapt.|bf
B|Yeah, I don't understand  that, they, they don't want to be with anybody else.|aa sd
A|Yeah. I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people. Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.|b sd sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and they do group things. And then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh, I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in. It's really kind of difficult.|sd sd sv sv
B|Yeah, I have a, um, my aunt's mother is, uh, gotten ill recently and, uh, she lives in Pennsylvania, they live in Alabama. And they're saying, hey, we need you to be closer and you have, women like that,|b sd sd sd sd sd sv

B|they don't get out of the house, they don't socialize but it's my home and I don't want to leave it.|sv sv ^q ^q
A|Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.|sv

B|Um.|%
A|They, they became, in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. And that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.|sd sd sd sd

I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long|b sv

And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots, but, uh, my mind has gone blank. I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for|b sd sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
B|you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on, and, uh, it's, it's interesting.|sd sv
A|Yeah, that would be. I usually vote. A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,|aa sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.|sd
B|Right. There for a while, that would, that worked. We've, uh, I know I have, um, I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.|b sv % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|or, you know, they're both just as bad, and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party, and, um, but yeah. You know, that's not the best way but,|sv sd % % sv %
A|No, I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.|aa sv
B|But it gets to the point where, I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.|sv sd
A|Right, and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.|b sv
B|Right, or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous.|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know, this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|it's just, it's just ridiculous.|sv
A|Yeah, I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.|b sv
B|Uh-huh, it really could, and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead, and they keep dragging it on, and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.|aa sv sd sd sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Yeah, so, uh,|b^m %
A|Yeah, the press has a lot of power.|b sv
B|They really do. I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more.|aa sv
A|Yeah, oh, but, boy you try get into that, you'd really open a can of worms.|b sd sv
B|Oh, yes, or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments, but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.|aa sd sv
A|Yeah, seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit, and I don't think they ever care to.|b sv sv
B|No, they don't.|aa sv
A|Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about.|fc
