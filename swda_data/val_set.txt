A|Okay. Do you, uh, do any woodworking?|b^m qy
B|I do, and I really love it. Um.|na sd
A|Oh, um, what do you do, for a hobby or for,|qo qy
B|Uh-huh, I do it for a hobby|ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I have my own equipment, and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, uh, in the process of getting a router|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out. What kind of things do you like to do with wood?|sd qo
A|Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out. My husband cuts them out|arp_nd arp_nd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is, is a lot slower|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and then, uh, he's got a router, but now he wants a plunge router.|sd sd
B|Oh. Yeah.|bk b
A|But anyhow, he cuts them out, and then I, I took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right, you know.|sd sd
B|Oh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|bk b b
A|And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and and see if we can sell some of them.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yes.|b b
A|But, uh, I really like it so far.|sd
B|Oh, that is fun.|ba
A|And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I took a pattern off of that, and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you, you make the dress for it, and you drill holes around the top of the head and you, you stick in uh, like rope and tie ribbons around it.|sd sd sd
B|Oh. Uh-huh, the twine. Yeah, those are so cute.|b b b b sv
A|It looked really cute, you know. So I've got a couple of those started.|sd sd
B|They are really cute.|sv
A|Yeah, and then uh, but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now.|aa sd
B|Oh, that is, that sounds really fun. well, they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah|ba sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just got back from that today, so if you could get your projects into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You could make a lot of money from those.|sv
A|What do you do? I wonder how you, you just, they buy them from you, or you just given them to them on consignment or something?|qo qw^d qy^d qrr
B|Uh, apparently, like that boutique, um, they take, oh what was it, twenty percent of the sell price.|na sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You would put your sell price|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|uh, and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter.|sd
A|Um, I see. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|bk b b
B|And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|So, you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.|sd
A|Oh, these little things are so cute, though, you know.|sv
B|They are.|aa
A|I.|%
B|I, I have seen those. Those are darling.|sd sv
A|I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Uh-huh. Oh.|b b
A|So, I'm just hoping that, you know, that we can get some cut out and painted, you know, before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time, you know.|sd

B|That sounded like one.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know, I've seen that for years, yeah.|sd sd %

B|The, the thing that, uh, uh, that Karen, my wife, has, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,|sd

B|And, uh, you know, those, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are, are real trouble,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I wonder whether that's just a, uh, uh, a part of the system, you know,|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|if, you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, uh, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there, there's an inefficiency there,|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and you've got to let those, you know, those,|sv
A|And speaking, speaking of doing what you want, uh, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one, um, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even, even something as simple as staying up late, um, watching television late, um, going out late, start dating,|sv
B|Uh-huh. Oh, oh yeah. Uh-huh.|b aa b
A|you start dating too early, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|just little things like that, that do start in the home,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|that can, that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day, or more in school and so any other part of your life, that's going to definitely affect your school life, because you spend so much time there.|sv sv
B|Yeah. And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive, you know,|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you, from the minute that you walk in until, until you leave, your, your competing against somebody else or your competing against, uh, a system or, or something, you know,|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and then, a lot of there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive. They're cooperative rather than competitive,|% sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and when they get into a real competitive system they just say, oh well, what the heck, and, uh, tend not to, you know, do too awful well .|sv
A|Uh-huh. Right, I talked to, a guy the other day and he is now in, in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he, he fell back several years ago and he's going to, he, he will have gone to school five years.|b aa sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he was having to, uh, support his entire family, take care of his brothers and sisters, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and all that had an adverse affect on his school life.|sd
B|I would think so, yeah.|ba %
A|And, yeah, and that, and that's a perfect example of how your home life, you know, plays a definite part. And, you know, any other aspect of your life,|b^m sv sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|aa aa
A|an, but now, now, that he's in this program and, you know, he's, I guess okay, he's, he's making straight A and, you know, it just, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah, it, uh, right, survival becomes more of a priority than, than education,|aa % aa bf
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|aa aa

A|Um.|b
B|The, uh, the cure, some of the cures that I've heard for this that, that sort of make sense,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at the, the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it's kind of these intervention programs. Now, a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism,|sd sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|and that's, you know, and then it gets political.|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, boy.|ba
A|When people start talking about programs that help, for me, I don't care if it's socialist, or I don't care, as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh, yeah.|aa aa
A|I mean, that's the point I'm at now. I mean that's the point we all should be at, is like finding some solution,|sd sv
B|Um, yeah.|b
A|I mean, you know, nothing totally radical, but if it's something that, you know, might help, you know, because there's not a lot being done.|sv sv sv
B|Well, you know, the, the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable. There are kids, families, that should just simply be taken out of the homes, you know. And, uh, uh, you know, uh, just removed from those situations,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.|aa aa b
B|or they're never going to get anywhere. But yet, politically that is not a very popular view.|sv sv

A|Take them out.|b
B|Yeah, you know how far you're going to get with that.|b qh
A|Yeah, not very far at all.|aa aa
B|Uh, but unfortunately it's, it's something like that, in lieu of that, you know, is the intervention programs in school where the, these kids are, are spotted fairly early on,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, you know, there's, well that's get to be a problem in Texas, you know, because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing,|sd
A|I mean it's, it's almost like, Right, right.|% aa aa
B|you got counselors and all that. But you know, you can counsel a kid eight hours a day and then he goes home and, and, uh, you know, in the, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or, or something like that,|sd sv sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|or they don't care. You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today, well who cares, you know.|sv sv sv
A|An a lot of it, a lot of the parents now are so young.|sv
B|True.|ba
A|You know, that they're, they still, they still don't know what's going on and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on. I mean it's just, it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, dead, smack dead in the center of|sv qh sv

Well, I know when the, I remember being a child and my grandmother had had several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents tried to keep her in the house, and they did for a long time. I couldn't,  tell you how long, until she got, uh, where she had to have complete care,|b b sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh. Well, maybe, well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it.|b sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way.|b sd
B|Oh, boy, yeah.|ba %
A|And that that, they couldn't, they found that they could not you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed.|sd

A|No, but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, you know,  in the nursing home.|aa aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do remember the other patients there, uh, being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone.|sd
B|Right. In fact, just, uh, just, uh, sit and chat with them for five minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is.|aa sv

Uh, just all this Roy Tarpley stuff and, and, uh, what is it their, you know, he got, he's in trouble again down in Houston and, and, uh, they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him, you know, if they don't trade him, they'll have to pay him off, you know.

B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And, uh,  not just, not just because they always win,|sd

B|Yeah. Well, they play better as a team than anybody else, seems like.|aa sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, they, they have in the paper, you know, like fifteen different categories and they'll have, like, a individuals, uh, they'll have the, the highest scorer, the top rebounders, uh, assists, foul shooting percentages and all that, and you go down through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't, uh, a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any, any, anybody in the top twenty except for, like, Magic|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah, year in and year out, it's not like they have, you know, a lot of teams will, will, will win in the playoffs and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff, to, to concentrate on the game.|aa sv sv sv

B|Yeah, they play two or three times a week. Like, you know, and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and, and then they, and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time.

Now I wear, uh, contacts, and I, I had my glasses on and I went down there and, and just jumped into the water where they were and it went right up over my head and I came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers|aa sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Uh.|b
B|Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know  the cash with me all the time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard, and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA.|sd sd
A|Okay. Absolutely. Right.|b b b
B|And so that's why I went ahead and got one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was a mistake|sd
A|Yeah. Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.|b sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't use them very often. Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I have a half a dozen department store credit cards, and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|just enough to keep them active. My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.|sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, and it saves a lot time. And that's what I was using it for. However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative, you must have the money to do this with, and you do not have any other options|sd sd sd ^q ^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I charged all three of those cards up, and right now I am paying and praying.|sd sd
B|I know how that goes|ba
A|But, uh,|%
B|and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b
B|we had no way around it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh|b b
B|and so like you were paying for it, but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.|sd sd
A|Well, I never did, Right. I never did use it for an advance. Most of my charges were, uh, medications.|sd sd sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|Didn't have cash for the medications or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.|sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, uh, uh, different labs will use those charge accounts for,|sv sv
B|What, Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't? I've found some doctors that say, you know, I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards, and so many of them don't anymore.|% qy ^h ^h na
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, I have not, like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.|% sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't generally charge. I say well, I need a checkup in six months, and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.|sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway, and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.|sv
B|Oh, it is|aa
A|It is easy, and it's very difficult to get out. I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.|sv sv sd
B|I know.|aa
A|I say wow, I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off. Big deal, I'm saving two percent.|sd ^q ^q ^q
B|Right. But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem, and I, I think about young people that think, you know, there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat, I have my first credit card|sv sv sv ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.|sd
A|Oh, yeah, and it's not just paying back what you've charged,|aa sv
B|You know.|qh
A|it's paying that and half again.|sv
B|That's right. That's right.|aa aa
A|Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars, you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.|sv sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You only get half of that paid for the principal, so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.|sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.|sd
B|No, and that's frightening to me.|aa sv
A|Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.|sd
B|That's right. That's frightening, too.|aa ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I work for T I but he doesn't|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed. I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases, and after ten years he's got two of them|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they should pay through next month, and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.|sd sd
A|Oh, right, right.|b b
B|And, you know, just in one lump, because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money|sd sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|aa aa
B|or it's like you say, you pay forever.|sv sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|aa aa
B|And so I'm really looking forward to that.|sd
A|Well, you either need a big chunk of money or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.|sv sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Now, those are very handy|sv
B|Right.|b
A|if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem|sv
B|Sure, yeah. I agree.|aa aa aa
A|because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.|sd
B|That's right|aa
A|But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money|sd
B|I know and,|aa %
A|And it just irks me. I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this, and I've got three cards. I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.|sd sd sd sd
B|I know. You're like what am I working for today|aa sv
A|Yeah, yeah. And that just blows my mind. I, my house is paid for, my car is paid for, I've got some home improvements, but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.|aa aa sd sd sd sd sd
B|It's incredible.|ba

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.|sd
A|That's right. I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.|aa sv
B|And, uh, Yeah. Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.|% b sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh, I went to a seminar, they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items. You only use credit cards for investments.|aa aa sd sd ^q
B|Right.|b
A|I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.|sd
B|It's, Sure. That's right.|% b aa
A|That doesn't make a bit of sense to me. I thought God dang, where is his pencil?|sv sd
B|That's right. Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables, don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,|aa sv sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and, and so that, that is the smart half.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot, but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off, so we cut that out real quick|sv sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|And, uh, but I, I do like having them there. There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use|sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or common sense not, not to get yourself in trouble.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.|b b sv

Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need. And the same way with those calls. What is it, oh M C I, M C I really does.

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Of course, he's breaking the law all the time, so it's a different story then. You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon. He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air, you know. And he has a chauffeur. Maybe he drinks but he never drives a car either, you know, it's not the same with Johnny Carson.|sv sv qh sv sd sv sv sv

B|Well see there's no way of knowing,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that's, you know, that's the problem. Like the product I sell, uh, I sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation. The only way we'd get to them is by telephone.|sv sd sd
A|Um.|b
B|And, uh, most of them like it because the company I work for is nationwide, and, uh, reputable and they know that hey, we're backing it, one hundred percent.|sd sd
A|uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because we offer it in a very low, you know, quantity. So I mean, I, I don't know what to do as far as that's concerned. But it is nerve racking. I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone, but at least, as I said, you can always say no thank you|sd sd sv sv sv

B|And you just know about what time, like some days I hate staying home because the phone rings all the time, but, uh, I don't know, I haven't been able to figure that out.

When they call up and want to say, well tell me this, this, this, this and I'll give you a free something or other, My answer is no thank you, I don't need it.|sv sv h sd sd sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh, why don't you go ahead first.|ad
B|Okay. Uh, short term, uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, uh extra to go around.|aa sd sd
A|Sure.|b
B|Uh, long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, uh, gee, she's eight now so I guess about ten years.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Good heavens. So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement. But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it.|ba sd sd
A|Sure.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|That's kind of, uh, to what we're doing is budgeting, you know. Month to month is, uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra so that's kind of how we do it, uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever.|% sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see  versus when it's on the paycheck|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and you have to try and take out some of that money. You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month so, uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, uh, it's automatically taken out. So, uh, that works out much better for us, so that's kind of how we do it anyway but,|sv sv sv sd sd %
B|And the old, uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, uh, idea|sv
A|exactly and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either. So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing, so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out. I'm going to keep it and, uh, keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money  left. Let's hope anyway, so  you'll have that|aa sv sv sv ^q sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|so that's kind of how we do it. But ours is more like month to month too, uh, short term is, to get things going so. Anyway, other than that, uh, is kind of how we do it so. I don't  know if we're, our time is up or what|sd sd sd sd qy
B|Uh-huh. Uh, they'll, uh|b %
A|They'll let us know|qy
B|Yeah, exactly. We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K. I just wish I could afford to, uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way,|ny sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Oh, definitely, definitely. And, uh, it grows, uh, it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and, uh, so, you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do. Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it.|b aa aa sv sv sv sv sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's put into our savings account and we don't see it, then it works out to where, you know, you don't look at it, you just look at the checking account, and say this is what we have for money and that's it, so|sd sd sv sv sv %
B|Yeah, checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced.|b sv
A|Yeah, it, it's easy because you do spend it, that's for sure. Like I said, you know, you kind of look at it, uh, you better have some other way of, uh, savings, otherwise, uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, you know, long term type of planning, so. And you don't get a good return on it anyway, so, other,|aa sv ba sv sv sv sv %
B|Yeah, I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days.|aa sv
A|Exactly. Right now. Yeah, it's a bad time, you know.|aa aa aa sv
B|Yeah, the interest is so low. I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in C D or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever.|aa sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Exactly, exactly. You know, we have some in-laws, uh, that, uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low but, uh, yeah, it's, it drops so your better bet is to, uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so.|b b aa aa sd % % sv sv %

A|Uh, I don't know about you, but, uh, I work outside the home and, uh, in fact, uh, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have I don't have the family time. Uh, when my husband gets home, it's usually, he's home with my daughter alone and then a couple of hours later I'm home. Uh, I don't know, I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less and less family time available to them. And, uh, it seems that business wise, uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family. So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children, and it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.|h sd sd sd sd sd h sd sv sv sv

A|Yes. Yeah Sure. Exactly.|aa aa aa aa

A|Uh-huh. Exactly.|aa aa
B|And I'm finding as I volunteer up at the school, I just, being, uh, I'm not educated at all in, uh, really detecting this but I can talk to the teacher and tell them, on a pretty good basis, after I've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Sure, sure.|b b b
B|And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that, uh, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need.|sv

A|Sure. Sure. Yeah, I, I ,|b b b %
B|Uh, I think the trend in the United States, I feel really bad that it's turned so much  to where the children are, uh,|sv sv
A|I think so too. In fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter, so I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that. And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks, whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four. But how these women must feel to place their children into care and, you know, it's our society saying yes, this, uh, you need this job. It's a little bit financial type thing because, uh, if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and  that's part of it too.|aa sd sd sd sv sv sv sv ^q sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job. Got a part-time job and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have the boat, I'll have the car and  it's nice|sv sv sv ^q sv
B|Right.|b
A|and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh, because it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and,|sv sv %
B|It's hard. It really is hard. I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of sacrificing  to keep me home.|sv sv sd
A|Uh-huh. Sure, I did it  for three years|b aa sd
B|And, uh,|%
A|and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home and you're not getting any further, you know, along|sd sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one.|sv sv sv
B|Right. I think  one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, how they spend their time with their children|aa sv
A|And I, Uh-huh.|% b
B|I think with working moms, if you can get them the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work,|sv
A|Sure.|b
A|Well, there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by, uh, Kitty Kelly, the unauthorized biography. Are you interested in that at all?|sv qy
B|Not really I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan, so I, I don't particularly read, um, biographies or autobiographies.|ng sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|I haven't read too many. I, I'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that, not of that nature though.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Well, I, the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to, I'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it. And I thought just purely for entertainment, I might enjoy that. But I, I wouldn't want to go out and buy it like, you know, the hard back copy of it.|b sv sd sv sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I might check,|sd
B|If they, if they had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though.|sd
A|Really.|b
B|I, I just, you know, I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago. For me it would be interesting to find out what life was, uh, like, you know, in that period. But, Not, not really interested|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. In biographies. Well, I, uh,  I have read some biographies. I prefer to read, if I read a biography, it's mostly because maybe I have to, uh, you know, back when I was in school I had to have information about that person or, um, preparing some kind of lesson and I need to have more information about people. But I, I do like to read some biographies, but that one just sounded like gossipy. And I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover, but flip through just for, just to get a good laugh.|b b sd sd sd sd sd sd sv sd
B|Yeah. I think the last biography that I read, I'm not, I think it was, it was, um, on Lady Randolph Churchill, Churchill's mother.|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that was excellent.|sd
A|Was it?|bh
B|Um, yeah. It was, it's in two parts. I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that, uh, because that was her name. And, um, I only got to read one part of it.|ny sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I've been looking for, you know, the other half of it and read the, I read that half where she was in her later years, and it was absolutely excellent. And it was very descriptive of, of people with money back then and, uh, affluents in England, uh, that, you know, were associated to the king and all. And it was,  really pretty fascinating.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I and that was actually a couple of years ago, so,  it's, it's been a while since I've read,  any biographies.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. A while.|b b
B|Uh, I love to read. I mean, I'm constantly reading. I read, I like, uh, mysteries, and I like, um, as far as improving myself, uh, I haven't read any lately. But I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before.  You know, that you might have needed to read in school, but that I just didn't read for some reason or another, another, or that, you know, that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of.|sd sd sd % sd sd
A|Uh-hum. Right.|b b
B|And you have so many out there that, uh, that you, you know, you never get a chance to read. And so, I said, well, I think it was because I read, um, Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES,|sv % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just, um, that, even when I read it now, it still makes me cry, the ending of it. And I couldn't believe, I, I could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'd read some Dickens before, but I hadn't read that one. And I, I was like, I thought to myself, you know, what other things are out there that are, that are classics,  you know, that have withstood time and that are just excellent,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written, you know, that was written about. And, um, so I started reading. I had this like, you know, I had a binge of my mother, uh, I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband, but my, uh, mother sent me, you know, like you know, uh, boxes full of different books.|sv sd sd % sd sd
A|Oh!|b
B|And, uh, she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over. But she, she is constantly, was, I guess because, it seems like, uh, older people have much better, uh, in their schooling, they, they got more of the classics than I did,  you know.|sd % sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she knows so much more of them than I do, I wouldn't even know, you know, to go look for that author or that book.|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|You know.|b
A|Well, I like the classics too. Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books. And I, well, I don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at, uh, well, like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out, paperback type books. Usually, I, I'm going to the book store for a particular reason, uh.|sd sv sd sd
B|probably you read a book review or something.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|A review on it.|sv
A|Yes, and, and, uh, I buy some of the, not self-improvement books, but, uh, self-help books like, we just bought a new house, so I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for, you know.  And, or how to repair this or repair that in your own home.|aa sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I bought that for my husband And, or how to, how to do something books, you know, for reference. And, uh, and those are really helpful I think in helping, um, well, you know, like some, symptoms, medical symptoms, like when, how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not,  type books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.|sd sd sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But purely just for enjoyment, I, I had a major in English and linguistics, and so I have a lot of books in my home that I can read from the classics, and I do enjoy those quite a bit. And, um, so I tend to, for reading just day to day, uh, you in sound know, I have a particular book I'm looking for or I just enjoy, uh, you know, the newspaper magazine.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's handy.|sv
B|Well, what I do is I usually have two books at one time. I have a classic which I have to work on, basically,  you know, uh, just depending, well, some authors I can just, you know, basically drink in,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but others, eh , I really do have to work at them. And then, um, whether, you know, they're a foreign author or whatever, um, or if it's their style or, or just understanding the material. And then I, you know, some of those, it's like I said, it's like school, you have to work at it.|sd sd % sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|But to me it's worthwhile in the end. I feel good about it, and I usually remember those a long time later. And then I have books that I read just purely for enjoyment,  you know.|sd sd sd sd
A|Light reading.|^2
B|I mean, yeah, just light reading that are, I particularly like Dick Francis books, and just some of the, the authors that are, uh, for mysteries, just, you know, just, uh, purely for entertainment,  you know.|% sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's it, I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it,  except to be momentarily pleased, you know, because I don't, I can never remember,  the plots or anything,  later on those books.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Right. Well, I think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things. It's not like, uh, most television where you, you know, you just, you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but,  still understand what was going on.|b b sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah, that, television, it gives you everything.|b aa sv
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Right.|b
B|But they give you everything else.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And it's usually, the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's, it's, it doesn't even have some of the underlying, uh, things to it, you know, that maybe the old movies and things had, you know, the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or, you know, like with Hitchcock or something where you're, you're, you're either expecting something or I, I don't know, it just, I don't really care much for T V at all. I just, I mean I sometimes get hooked into it, but I really, I really get mad at myself when I do, because I I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for,  T V.|sv h sd % sd sv
A|Not too much.|aa
B|No.|aa
A|Not too much. Well, that's right. Well, I think it is good to, to read books and, and, because even if it's, like you say, it's light reading, you are still getting some, uh, mental exercise|aa aa sv
B|Yeah. You're developing your imagination. You know, when you develop your imagination, that can take you into a lot of other areas, because you've developed, uh, your, your, your mind in, in seeing things, you know,  even if it's your own set way, you know,|aa sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|it's, you're, you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind.|sv

A|Hi.|fp
B|Well, what do you think?|qo
A|Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons. Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now, and if they were to administer this, they would, uh, get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves. Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bureaucratic mess. And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction. Although that we have problems right now and I do agree that they exist because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.|sv sd sv sv sv sv sd sv sv aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|How do you feel about the whole ordeal?|qo
B|Well, I agree that it's a big task, but I think that, I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan. At least as a long term kind of goal.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing, but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to, uh, and not have a completely socialized, medical system in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now.|sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh. Okay.|b bk
B|It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit perhaps|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and so that, and  that's a   that's a vicious cycle, of course.|% sv
A|But what, What you're  Yeah, so what you're  saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.|% % bf
B|Because,|%
A|Is that is that correct,|qy
B|Um,|b
A|or do you think that,|qrr
B|Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately. I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea. And, uh|arp_nd sv %
A|Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh, because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes and the, the the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the, the public themselves get health insurance|qy sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|and they provide their own health insurance.|sv
B|The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance and so that the other people have no health insurance and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies and somebody winds up paying for that and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance so I don't see that anything, that this situation would get any worse. That way it might get better.|sv sv sv sv sv sv sv
A|You think it might get better, huh? I, I kind of disagree|qy ar
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The reason being is, uh, we have, I don't know, I guess it's my, my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it|% h sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business. People would still have to pay taxes, the money would have to come from somewhere and so you'd I, I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also. But in the same sense the, the care and the, the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical, uh, field would, would diminish.|sv sv sv % sv sv

A|I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently, and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana, I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay|sd sd sd
B|Oh, my goodness,|ba
A|and it would, that would, tied up traffic for a long time, everybody died, the fire was terrible, it was awful. So, yeah, I think you're right, I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field, but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,|% sd sd sd sd % sv sv qh
B|They, that's, that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle I mean.|% sv qh
A|Right, yeah I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested|aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know, even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught|h sd
B|Right.|b
A|that make sense?|qy
B|Yes, uh, it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh career.|ny sv
A|Yeah, and then, uh, I think, Yeah. I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.|aa sv b sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone|sv
B|Right. Uh-huh|b b
A|I don't, I don't know.|h
B|however, here in Dallas uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team|sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing, and was to the point, he was on probation, he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract, and they wouldn't have to pay him, and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him, but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract|sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive,|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah,|b b
B|so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.|sd
A|Get rid of him. Right, yeah.|^2 b b
B|And so, in his case, he lost his whole career, he's been in the paper, in jail, and it's just been awful|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and talk about a terrible role model,|sd
A|Right, I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible you know, it's really funny though, um, I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school|aa sv sv sd
B|Um. Oh, my goodness.|% ba
A|and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school and a friend came and got me, and I was there, and I could smell the dope, and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and nothing ever happened, and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,|sd sd
B|Oh, that's terrible. Uh-huh.|ba b
A|but I really, uh, I'm so anti drunk driving, and, and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects|% sd sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on the subject.|sd
B|I think most of us are.|sv
A|Yeah, but as I've, as soon as that happened, I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.|sd
B|Yes, if you know someone, for example we have, uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver|aa sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the drunk and his wife in the car were killed, and, uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|he went through surgery after surgery|sd
A|Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff.|sd
B|and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again. And he, as far as his athletics, he's lost all of that.|sd % sd
A|Right.|b
B|He, uh, has been tutored, and he'll catch up in school and everything, but, he's still not back where he was.|sd sd sd
A|Right, yeah, I don't think somebody,|b b sv
B|He may never have all those motor skills back.|sd
A|Yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.|b sv
B|No.|aa
A|I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life. You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.|sd sv
B|Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train. Well, he, the train missed him, but, uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|he was in a coma for four months,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he's out of the coma now, and eventually they think he will come back, but you don't know that, and|sd sd sd %
A|Right.|b
B|but he's lost, he was an outstanding football player,|sd sd
A|Well let's see, um, I, I like to go out to eat, I really do, but being from Dallas, um, I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every month and we we have a really high turn over rate.|^h sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Oh yeah and, and this is, I mean there are streets just called restaurant rows and, uh, you can get everything here from, um, a very spicy Indian meal to, you know, the favorite barbecue and, and, uh, just anything your little hearts desires around here, so, here they have to entertain us to make us come back.|ny sd sd sd
B|Uh.|%
A|And I guess it's all one big game because you, you just never run out of places to go, you really don't.|sd sd
B|That's good.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|I never really thought about that, but, uh, a good turn over would be sort of nice. Course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it, it would be sort of sad to see it go under.|sd sd sv
A|Really and, and we go to, you know, like an older part of town and we just notice how many, oh well that restaurant's changed, and oh, gee, there, they've changed and, oh, we've got to go try that one, you know, and it's, it's really, you have the pick of the, you know, the crop here.|aa sd sd ^q ^q ^q % sd
B|Are they big into ambiance down there or is it more like,|qy qrr
A|Oh!|b
B|uh, Texas to me makes it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing.|sd sv
A|You know, your, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff.|bf
B|Yeah, right, uh-huh.|aa aa aa
A|Um, you can get that too. No, they've got everything here from the, uh, French Room which is ultra, ultra to, um, um, Dean Ferrings , uh, uh, restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek. I mean we've got beautiful places to go. You can get as dressed up or, you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out.|sd ar sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, you know I guess, uh, some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the, um, um, like Chinese,|sd
B|Um|%
A|and we're always searching around for Chinese. And now, of course, they've added the Taiwanese, and, and, um, uh, various, you know, any, any part of the country you want to hit, they have got it. I mean, Vietnamese restaurant we went to, you know, last week. It's great, it's good stuff, you|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, it's, so it's very, very mixed and, uh, you know, I think if you like food like we do, I, I don't know if that happened before or after we moved here but, um,  you know, you get a lot of, uh, great variety of things here,|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so. But if you were going to a restaurant, say, um, where would you go?|% qw
B|Oh, well we had, uh, we have a lot of favorites here, uh, in Northern Virginia and of course we've got D C to call on, you know,|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and there's all sorts of things down there. One thing about D C is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where, you know, it's, the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years, you know,|sd sd sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|and he's got a big clientele and, um, so there are, there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people. You know, it's, it's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there's, there's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that.|sd sd sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Um, we don't hang around with them, because usually it's, you know, ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that.|sd
A|Yeah, right|aa aa
B|So, uh, but, uh, my wife has a, a friend that runs one of the restaurants down there and we've been down there and had French cuisine, and, uh, I don't know, I don't particularly care for that sort of thing, just the type of food, just because I do like, uh, you know, getting a meal.|sd sd h sd
A|I see.|b
B|And, uh, most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason. I, I don't know what they say about Chinese, I'm always hungry after a French meal, uh.|sd sd sd
A|That's true too.|aa
B|And, uh, but the, the atmosphere is just wonderful. You do feel like you've gone out, you know, and done something,  when you go to a French restaurant, or a restaurant downtown.|% sd sd
A|To another place, yeah.|bf aa
B|Well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied, it's not so much a, an event, you know, out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant.|sd
A|Yeah, well.|b %
B|And there's, they're starting to get a little bit different, um, they're, they're realizing that more of the, the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs, getting away from the city and so there are a couple jazz houses, you know, that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that,  which is kind of nice, because,|sd sd sd
A|Oh, there you go, yeah. Oh, we're sort of in the middle of, uh, the extension of the Cajun country too, so we have, um, a lot of ambiance provided by, you know, the, the bands and you know, like you said jazz bands and things like that. You know,  you go out|ba b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff.|sd
B|Yeah right.|b b
A|You know, I, I really don't like that stuff but my husband does. He loves to cook it so,  he and a friend of his get together|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they cook, I mean, you know, like for a bunch of people and, and, uh, it's really, in fact, we do a lot more entertaining I think at home than we do going out. So when we do go out we really, you know, want to be wowed by, um, the presentation, so to speak.|sd % sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, you know, but, but there are little places, um, and like I said, some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants, just to,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's the fastest thing to do,|sd
B|We have two, uh, two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to. Uh, one's called Captain Pell's which is a crab house,  you know, being so close to Maryland.|sd sd
A|Oh. Right.|b b
B|Maryland is, you know, a big place for crabs with the, with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, um, Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside, and people just go in there and just pig out and everything. And then, um, the other place is called the Vienna Inn which is, uh, uh, Vienna is a suburb of D C also in Virginia and, uh, that place is known for the, the rudest waitresses in the country, are, are at the Vienna Inn. And, uh, people go there to be abused. I mean, you actually go in there to be abused by the, by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff. And people come all over the country amazed at, um, the abuse they were seized. And then it's on the honor system. You pay totally on the honor system.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Um.|%
B|And so, you know, you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever and they figure out the bill for you and you're lucky if you get change. Usually they, they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks, you know. Because, uh, they,|sd sd sd sd %
A|Got to carry through with the abuse, huh.|^2
B|Yeah, carry on with the abuse, they say you need mints, here guy, you don't get any change, you know.|aa b^m sd ^q
A|Oh, gee. Well that's funny, I, we just went to an Italian restaurant this, um, just wonderful and they, I mean it's like being in I mean I've never been to Italy, okay, but it's just this big beautiful Italian restaurant. Very, um, low key in terms of the people are from California, you know, so they have their own adaptation of what Italian is. I mean, but it's, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. You know they have, uh, women there going to S M U, going to, uh, Southern Methodist University and, and graduating in opera or something like that and they are all singing arias to you and,  and just walking around the restaurant singing|ba sv sd sd % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and they make the food right there so it's display cooking and, and, uh, then they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place and you just take a drink of wine and, you know, they don't count that really, they just,|sd sd sd sd %

B|Huh.|b
A|Um, uh, in, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, when they get winters it's, um, the winters are bad, but not what you hear about. It's just like down here, when you hear, when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here.|sd sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|It's nice to see those who , guys. They have such good style that, uh it's, uh, it's pretty fun to watch.|sv sv

A|I mean, it, they do, they do a generally okay job but like you said, it's, it's kind of boring actually.|sv sv

B|Right.|aa
A|But, uh, that's, that's wild though. I'll have to see if I can't get a chance  to go,|sv sd
B|You got I mean it's, uh, it's a lot more exciting than actually than watching it on T V. And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around, I mean, it's just, watching them the whole time instead of like on T V, you get to see them make a tee shot|% sd sd

A|Yeah, that's a good thing.|aa sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, it, it's unfortunate, you know. You hear about Japan. I guess, you know, it's, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to, like to practice even .|sv sd

B|that is out of control. I mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf.|sv sv

B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, they kicked our butt all the way to,|sd
A|What do you think about, uh, the way the criminal justice system handles trials?|qo
B|Well, you know, they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, you know, it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people, like the juries that I've served on, are businessmen.|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Okay now they don't understand that, you know, maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven. *Seven Eleven|b sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars, all the time, so, you know, I think that it, a trial by your peers should be exactly that, someone in your own age bracket, someone that, you know, you can't really do it ethnically, you know, but you could do it, you could probably get it a little closer.|b sd sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I don't know why they do that. Do you have any reason, do you know of any reason why they do that?|sd qy qy
A|Well, I think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial.|sd sd
B|Okay, see|bk %
A|Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of, you know, and held over for trial.|sd
B|Okay I don't know much about the Grand Jury. How do you feel about the, in Texas I noticed since I've been here, in twelve years that they, they break up the, the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial.|b sd qw sd
A|Yeah, I don't know. I, I think that, uh, I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked. However,|b h % sd %
B|Well, we know there's a few out there.|sv
A|Yeah. It seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it, you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for, you know, if, if, if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off, much easier than twelve people could.|aa sv % sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah it's, Yeah, would be pretty hard. Well I don't think, you know, I don't think that, if I was the criminal, that I would like the judge passing sentence on me. If the jury found me guilty, then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be. And I think it's, not only that, it's a waste of our money. We have to have a trial for this person, then two weeks down the road we have to excuse me, set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again|b b % aa sv sd sv % sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's more money spent.|sd
A|It's not so much that I, that, I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges. What bothers me is that, uh, they really don't mean anything.|sd
B|No.|aa
A|Someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years and yet, you know, the, the parole system, it's going to let them out in, in three years for good behavior.|sd sv
B|And it's not working either.|sv
A|No, it's not.|aa aa
B|It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know, I don't know how you all are there where you're at, but where we're at, now our jails are overcrowded. We just built a brand new one two years ago.|aa sd sd sd
A|Oh, I think they're all overcrowded.|sv
B|And it's overcrowded.|sd
A|They've, uh,|%
B|So now they start turning them loose.|sd

B|They turn them loose.|sd
A|Well, no, I mean, they're not allowed to accept any new inmates.|ar sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail? You know.|qw %
B|Well, the way, it seems the way it's been working here's,|sd
A|There, yeah,|%
B|Go ahead. * LISTEN are utterances 1 and 2 really from the same speaker? It seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence, or five to life.|ad sd
A|Uh-huh. Something that is working and I, I really like the system of house arrest where a, a, someone's wear, someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,|b sd sd
B|Yeah that, Yeah, and they, They keep,|b % b %
A|and they are not allowed, I mean, some of them are even allowed to work, they can go to their regular job, they come home, they have to be home by such and such a time, they're instructed, uh, so that, this, this electronic monitor is turned on at, at a certain time|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts.|sd
B|All right.|b
A|And, uh, they can put a, they usually install a video monitor in the house and when the parole officer calls to check on them, they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it. So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing|sd sd sd
B|All right.|b
A|and that's working rather well. That's a good system. That allows people, to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, you know, paying back for whatever crime they've committed.|sv sv sv
B|Yeah, instead of being completely penned up. And that way it would give, you know, the probation department and parole department, they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in, in Lubbock.|aa bf sv sd
A|Oh, yeah, yeah.|b b
B|And that would give, you know, at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy, or trying to see six or seven people.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. I, I've really, I could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what I think we ought to do about it. But, Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work, that they should,|b % sd sd
B|Sometimes it's pretty messed up, isn't it. Uh-huh.|sv ^g b
A|I, and this may sound cruel, but I do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes. I mean they're in jail for crying out loud.|% h sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|What do they need cigarettes for?|qh
B|Well, see and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like and there's a lot of people that tell me that, that maybe my thoughts are wrong. I came from California|% sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they clean the city parks.|sd
A|Oh, I think that's a wonderful idea.|sv
B|And they clean the city streets. But you know, we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner,|sd sv sd
A|More than that.|sd
B|and I know, yeah,|% b
A|More than that.|sd
B|but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|And they're not, you know, they're not doing anything to support themselves, while they're there.|sd
A|The thing that, the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them, they're working.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|When they get out of jail they get handed all that money.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That really ticks me off. I think that while they are in jail and they are working, their wages should go,|sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|like, I don't know, they could, some percentage, like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year.|h % sv
B|Yeah, well, Uh-huh. See now .|b b %
A|And when they get out they should have a, I don't know, you know, some reasonable amount of money to start, like a couple of thousand dollars,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but there should be a limit over which they, that it all goes back to the State. Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that, you know, there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with.|sv sv
B|Yeah, but at least they would, at least that way they would be helping pay for their own.|aa sv
A|Exactly, absolutely.|aa aa
B|And something else that I would, And something else that I would like to see is, is, uh, victim reimbursement, you know, because they, you know, like you say these guys are in jail|sd
A|That's the part that I really think we need to change.|sv
B|and they're working, they're getting paid, but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from, or beat to death or,|sd sd sv %
A|Has nothing, right.|^2 aa
B|has nothing, you know. Our, our victims are victimized, period, and the law has no, no, uh, regulations to deal with that.|sv sv sd
A|Absolutely.|aa
B|They, they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal, but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens, I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect.|sv sv sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But it's, but I sure don't, I, I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself.|% % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There that,|%
A|I think it works much better if it's, if it's the actual jury.|sv
B|Yeah, because, well, see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime,|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge, but you know, if, if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances, or something like that whereas maybe the judge does, just doesn't care, you committed this crime so I'm just going to throw the book at you.|sd sv ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, you know, he did this, but, you know, why did he do this,|sv ^q ^q
A|Yeah, in some, cases it would work that way.|aa sv
B|is there, is there a basis for it.|^q
A|In some cases it would work the other way.|sv
B|Yeah, in some cases where the judge says okay, I'll give you, you know, two to three years and,|aa sd %
A|The jury would, would, slam them and, and I think that, that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Well, they have a stronger debate, too, because there's twelve people there. They have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in at the same time and decide what his punishment would be,|b sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you'd have more than one person's input on it.|sd
A|Yeah. I think that's probably a much fairer way.|aa sv
B|And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society. So, you know, if you can find me guilty, then you ought to be able to pass sentence.|sd ^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|And a lot of jurors, not that I know of, but, you know, a lot of jurors may just sit there and say, yeah, he's guilty, but I don't have to deal with it from here, you know, so the judge takes care of all of that.|sv sd sv ^q sv
A|Yeah. It might be more, it would be more work for the jury, but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it.|b sv sv sv

A|Okay, yeah.|b
B|and then it won't go away and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know. There are evenings especially Friday nights, Thursday and Friday nights. Well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night.

B|Huh. Yeah I,|b b %
A|But your right. *your you're That was a good one.|aa sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not. And they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it. Like if you order something through a mail order catalog,  you know, then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in.

You know, I, they're great for an office but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so I could talk about him,  he uses his speaker phone all the time, and it carries over and so not only would you hear, it seems to me that you talk longer from you kind of yell into it.|b sd % sv sd sd sd sv

B|Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's see, I'm trying to think. Oh, have you heard that, that, I'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status.|aa aa ^h qy

B|Well, um, I work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing.|sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,  because it was such a big deal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either. I mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it.|sd sd
A|Well, I, uh, heard something similar to that. I listen to, I'm a, uh, uh, talk show person. And there was,|sd sd sd %
B|Okay.|b
A|when I, when I do my chores up at the I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,  and Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily, even a, your Social Security number, you know, they,  you should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer.|sd sd
B|Huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Whether it's your personal salary or whatever. Uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down and I was curious as to you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down.|sd sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|But he says Social Security, you don't need to put that down there. Which I thought was surprising. So maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there. It would be nice to know what's, what was, of course, of course, they could say, well, I can't give you a card, and you could say, fine, but, you know, some things will be private, you know, but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money they want your card. But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Well, that's real interesting. I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,  on several things and, you know, your credit ap and all, all they ever need you to do is give them permission to, to pull a credit thing on, on yourself|b ba sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|and there it is. That's all they really care about.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|They just want that credit history to see if you're a person. If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that.|sd sd
A|I haven't, I don't have any friends down at the, the Austin plant, but I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing, and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that, I don't have any trouble with it. Uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through and wasn't really, no one was, I guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in Austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it,  that they were objecting to|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|But I do know that there are several sites . I didn't, I wasn't aware that Austin was one of them, but I think Johnson City was one.|sd % sd sd
A|Oh, did they object too?|qy
B|Yeah, there's, there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue. And the, but also on things that I'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people, uh, there were, the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too.|ny sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, well, I'm, I'm all for it. I, uh, it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, uh,  uh, of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school|b b sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it. Uh, uh, and I think it is, they, they found that it's been very low really.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess maybe at the locations though, I don't know if they have it done but, done it by location. I don't really know if, uh, they need to publish that really.|sd sv
B|Oh, I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis.|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|I mean,  if they're going to do it, just deal with it and,  be done with it.|sv
A|Right. Right. But I think that was an actually a good thing that happened, uh, I never considered it, I guess, it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to,  have everyone, uh, take the test right away|aa aa sv sv

A|and, uh, and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, uh, I might as well get off, you know, if I want to stay so, you know,  if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.|sd
B|Oh, I,  Oh, I think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for the, their co-workers, you know,  it's like, you know, my father was a fireman|sv

I'm forty so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal and, uh, that was a real interesting time and, you know, the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound. Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart I mean because it's just, it will always be there. It's classic and I don't have to worry about, you know, what's current and what's not because I haven't been current with music for a long time. But, you know, same, uh, and, as far as country music is, I've never really, uh, listened to it.

B|Uh|%
A|I, it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too. I, I know, well, whenever they talk about, uh, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me. It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.|% sv sv sv

I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night.

A|Right.|b
B|I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which  has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was the explosions and that kind of thing. My husband will say how did you know about that. Yes, it happened at such and such time And that's so, that, that's different for me. So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.|sd sd ^q ^q sd sd
B|Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely noting of the events as they happen? Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?|qy qy
A|Uh, no it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know. It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred|nn sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it happened and,|sd %
B|Well, I, myself, uh, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.|sd
A|Right, right.|b b
B|The local doesn't either but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.|sd sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And perhaps newspapers do that but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when I have read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.|sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Huh.|b b
B|So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too. Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it. But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.|sv qh sd sv
A|Right. Right. It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.|aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That kind of thing.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|So. Uh,|%
B|I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world  rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred|sd
A|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
B|I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture. Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail. I don't know|sd sd h

A|So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.

B|Um, there, there're some places that are strongly encouraging it, and that they city will pick it up. That's been one of the arguments here. I'm just sitting here looking. We've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff. But we have to carry it, uh, some distance, and some places, um, you can sell your, uh, recyclables, and, for example, our church was collecting newspapers.|na sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah, when I was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing. We got like a penny a pound for them.|b sd sd
B|Well, it turns out that so much, the problem in Texas is that, uh, they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to, uh, reprocess it.|sd sd
A|Oh, my,|ba
B|It requires an it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it, and so the value has gone down. It turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do.|sd sd sd
A|Oh, I didn't realize, you would think, now up here, I, I suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of, uh. Actually there is one in northern Vermont. So there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here. I didn't think that, you know, in the large city that if the next recycling, if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport.|ba sv sv sd sd sd sd sv
B|Well, Yeah, well see, that's, in, in Dallas there no plan to build, I think there, there's some in East Texas there's some pulp mills, but, uh, you have to go to Houston, and, it's interesting, and then there's places that will buy metal and they still buy aluminum can and likes that. *can cans ? likes like?|% b % sd sd sd sd sd sd

B|Oh, that's it, you'll, you'll, there is a down side to all this, you know, about no good deed going unpunished, that, uh, my mother sells, um, trees that they make paper out of, and so every time I recycle newspapers, in fact there's a, there's a, uh, Kimberly and Clark, the makers of kleenex and such has a, uh, a big paper mill.|sd % sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|In fact I almost went to work for them. I was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me. It's twenty or thirty miles from my house. Every time you recycle, that's one less tree my mother can sell, and, uh. So, it's a question should I be diligent and, um, and, and recycle, and put my mother out of her livelihood.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|They don't either|sd

A|Yeah, like I say, it's not a very controversial thing. Everyone thinks we should do it. It's just that we're so lazy, I mean, like personally, I don't want to clean my, I just have can cat food.

A|You know, I'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash.|sd

A|Yeah, I think I would be like, when I bring my bottles back. If they're pretty clean and stuff, so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months, and I get a whole bunch of them and bring them and bring them over. Now, if I had a recycling center and I kept it clean, like if I washed all the cans and things, I wouldn't mind if it sat around too much, but if, if it stunk or something I wouldn't like doing it.

A|but when they sell juice, it's some strange quirk in the law, you don't have to have a deposit on it. And even like, the, a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it, but if it's got soda in it, it does. So, it's a strange.|sd sd sd sd
B|That's an interesting distinction.|sd
A|Yeah, they should, they should clean, clear that up. It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, uh, juice cans as easily as the soda.|b sv sd

A|So, but redemption centers are a big thing up here, they get a penny a can they handle. They give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor. I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can.|sd sd sd sv
B|Well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes, yet that's the big debate here in Texas, that the legislature wants to put one in,|sd sd

A|Well. Yes, well, I know, I was in Atlanta, and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand. But here, Let me put that in a paper cup for you. So that was strange. But, I think, if some people they have, they say, well, we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these, um, the, the recycle center, you have to deal with the can and then you have to, to recycle it, and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it,|% b sd sd sd sd sv sv sv sv

B|Well, uh, I probably a little bit older than you are, so what I see, uh, is, the change that I see the most is, is that, uh, women have much more, many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I went to college.

B|And, uh, not that I would give the career up because it's, it's a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I I need the income.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, uh, and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have, have started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must.|sv
A|I think that's right.|aa
B|Uh, you just, it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh, the male, uh, has an extraordinarily good job.|% sv

B|Uh, it's just an economic need now.|sv
A|I really think women have so much more responsibility than, you know, as far as everything.|sv
B|Oh, definitely.|aa
A|And, like you said, uh, one, women today have so many, uh, the average today of having a, a single family, you know, with the mother as the head,  you know, it just really, uh, so commonplace,  nowadays.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Oh, yes, exactly. We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and,  uh, the majority is, uh, married couple with children,|b aa aa sd sd

A|Right, right.|b b
B|And, uh, but I'm all, I'm really grateful that I went to college. My mother always said, you know, get an education in case you need one, because my father died when we were, I have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died and she had a nursing degree,|sd sd sd sd sd

B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|But, but the girls especially.|sv
B|Yeah, I do, too. But I think it needs to continue to change and I I think it, there's still not equality as far as, uh, paychecks for men and women. I think that the, we still have a long way to go.|aa aa sv sv sv
A|A lot of things, yeah.|^2 %
B|Uh-huh. And I think that, uh, I think by the year two thousand it, we're going to see some, a lot more changes, uh, hopefully, that women are, you know, able to get the, the executive jobs,  and hold positions that men, men do because they can do it just as well, you know,|aa sv
A|Right.|b
B|if they want to dedicate their, most of their time to that they, they're, they can do it.|sv
A|Yeah. And I also think that in the future that, uh, it's going to continue. We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force.|b sv sv
B|Uh-uh.|b
A|I think they're going to stay there and I think that they're going to, uh, uh, be really responsible and, and do everything just like, what you said, you know, make, make it the grade and, and make it so women can be the top people in their,  in their field.|sv sv
B|Exactly. Exactly. And I think that's the way it should be. I think it|aa aa sv sv
A|Oh, I think so.|aa
B|I mean, not that I, I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, could never do strength wise and so forth|sv
A|Right.|b
B|but, also there's some things women can do like have children,  that men can't do.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, you know, it, I don't I don't want to be equal but, I, I want to be, I want to get what I deserve and I want to be able to be on the same level with them. If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay, you know.|% sd sd sd sv
A|Exactly.|aa
B|And, And I just, I'm not a women's libber.|sd
A|Exactly.|aa

A|That's right. And I think that is happening more and more.|aa sv

B|Oh.|b
A|so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now,  with it.|sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|So what do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job. I think they have a long way to go yet but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier. You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers, and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done. And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.|sv sv sv sd sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together. And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think, they literally cannot come in out of the rain.|sv sv sv
A|That's right|aa
B|You know, and that just, I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.|% sv
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education. So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have, and I think that's very, very important.|sd sv sv
A|Yes, it is. I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, we have a, uh, fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergarten and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.|aa aa sv sd sd sd

A|Right.|b
B|You know, so they're really, they're really moving them along but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life.|sd sd
A|Now,|%
B|And that's you know, a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.|% sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.|sv
A|Correct. Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time? Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.|aa qy sd
B|Yes, that's a,|ny %
A|And, and are you, do you find that?|% qy
B|Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,  things so that they compare|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it. And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,  you know, that I think it's, uh, I think it's crazy personally|sd sv
A|Be, uh-huh.|% b
B|You know, the the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,  October. So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States.|sd sd
A|Coming up, uh-huh.|^2 b
B|And I think that's totally useless. I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous. It's like bragging on your grandchildren.|sv sv sv sv
A|Right|b
B|You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this, and that's great. But that's what they're doing with the school systems and they're wasting too much time on that, I think.|sv sv sd sv sv

And they had quite a few, uh, locations, not quite a few, several, in Latin America. I think the one in New Mexico is closed and I think the one in, in Brazil is closed, but I, I don't know why that is a problem down there and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and, uh, an some people say go to New York, but I don't, I don't have an answer to the crime rate. It's sad. That is a sad situation. I, I'd like to go down to Mexico, you know, and I keep hearing that, you know, the government and, and the crime rates pretty high too, that, that is sad.

We have more, I guess ties, we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really, aren't that close to everyone in South America.

Yeah, I know that I saw in a book, I was reading a Spanish book, uh, not that I read Spanish, you know, I just, you know, reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans. They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too, you know, and I guess that's true. We don't think of any one else but I guess, we're kind of, uh, the smart asses in the world, I suppose, uh, or of America anyway. We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too.|b b sd sd sd sd sd sv sv sv sv

A|No, no, they, they were lucky enough to have some oil, what, ten years ago, an, and they, they blew all that, and borrowed more money than they can pay back now and, uh, uh, so they're not exactly business men. I do think we should deal more with them. I don't, I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, uh, for the language, you know, is very foolish. I'm relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in, uh, grammar school, you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish. I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, uh, and there are problems with, you know, the wet back problem, you know, for, everyone knows what we're talking about, say wet back problem. And then we should somehow, uh, and I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, uh, businesses, uh, at the borders of both sides so that you can, you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an, to, to get the jobs, you know, there, there may be some organized way to do this.|aa aa sv sv sv sv sd sd sd sd sv sv sv sv sd sv sv

A|I think a, a common factor to a lot of problems, both, whether it be crime, if, if you want to jump on that, is mostly, uh, poverty. Uh, and I think a lot of their problems is poverty. If we could, uh, uh, the problems we have, in this country, is, is a lot of it's poverty. Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, I, that's another story, but, uh, uh, it is sad. There, there's so much down in all of South America, uh, so much potential, you know, we're, T I, of course is, is really pushing world markets in their products and they're, they're mostly in, in Europe now and, in, in, in the Orient, Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore, uh, they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're, they haven't had, what, that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything.|sv sv sv sv sv sd sv % sd sd sd sd sd

B|That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.|aa
A|Yeah, it seems sensible and failsafe. I, I, uh, I don't, you know, not completely failsafe, but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.|b sv % sv sv
B|Right.|aa
A|Uh I also, uh, to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, uh, I believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh from society,|% sv
B|Right. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b
A|and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure|sv
B|Yeah, you're, you're right there. Uh, I basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that I just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.|aa aa % sd
A|Uh-huh. Right. Right.|b b b
B|I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with|sv
A|Right.|b
B|so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I, I'm all in favor of it.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Well, uh, do you, uh, are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?|b qy qy
B|Well, I, I really don't know on that question. It just seems like, for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society. I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets|h sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty, so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment|sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live, but, you know, then you're kind of playing God which is never a good thing to do.|sv sv
A|That's true, yeah. Right.|aa aa aa
B|But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of. I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or serial killers|sd sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that. I think that they're, they're operating on a more, I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here, but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because they're feeding our consumer needs.|ar sv sv sv
A|Right. Sure, yeah, I understand, I understand your point. Yeah. Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty.|b b b sd % qy^d sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|Yeah, so, uh, that was a curious case. I.|b sd %

B|Yes.|b
A|Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.

B|That's right.|aa

A|Uh-huh. You didn't?|b qy
B|No, I never did. Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places. I couldn't go by myself.|nn sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah, that's true. That's true.|aa aa aa
B|And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess. So|sd %
A|Oh yeah. I guess that for me it was very helpful. My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.|b sd sd
B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And so we, we went quite often and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing. When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago and we would go skiing and enjoy that.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.|sd sd sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|So,|%
B|Yeah, I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me|b sd

A|Uh-huh, yeah, it really is.|aa aa aa
B|More than competitiveness against someone else. It's, it's a competitiveness against yourself.|sv sv
A|And, you know, it's so frustrating, I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating. You think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot better, you know, and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's just terrible.|sd qh sd sd sd sd

A|Uh-huh. Well, I've only been playing like about three years now. My husband's played for twenty-five. But, I just took it up about three years ago and, uh, we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments. We belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas,|b sd sd sd sd sd

B|And if, if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green, so be it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be better|sd
A|Yeah, I have never played in any tournament except just a scramble. They have a lot of them there at the club, you know, they have A B C D type tournaments and then they, they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well, but, I don't know, I've just never really gotten into that.

A|Yeah.|b
B|I never I never quite found a New York fan. I always found a fan, you know, of either one or the other, and so, that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox by default, because I went to college also in Boston.|sd sd sd

B|Well, I don't know. Um, there's, there's a part of me that says that, you know, um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away. You know, when, when he sort of went away, I started thinking, yeah, well, he was performing fairly well, but he really wasn't worth the baggage, you know.|h sd sv

B|Um, I mean, certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, you know, um, eight years ago or something, they're they're, they're, they're, you know, they're sort of in, in good standing, whereas, you know, um, I think, I certainly don't think they're the eighty-six team any more.|sv

B|I, I, that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year, I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself up.|% sv
A|Yeah, I mean, they've been, they've been young for a while, and they're almost starting to age a little bit here, I just, um. Yeah, yeah, they, they really hurting pitching wise.

A|In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.|sv
B|Do you? Why?|^g qw
A|Why? Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.|qw sv
B|You think the problem is not enough doctors?|qy
A|I think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your uh, I mean, on your liability.|na
B|Gosh, for one thing.|ba
A|Oh? Uh-huh. And you think there are plenty of doctors?|bh b qy
B|Oh, yeah, I don't think there is a shortage of doctors and I do know that O B, which is my field the doctors' health the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies.|ny sd sd
A|Uh-huh. It's astronomical.|b ba
B|Now they can't doing anything about that. I don't think they're in a conspiracy. I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.|sv sv sv
A|No, people don't sue|ar sv
B|People are very sue, sue conscious.|sv
A|lawyers sue. If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor|sv sv
B|Yeah. Well, that's probably true, too. But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.|b aa sv
A|Well, sure.|ba
B|And, so,|%
A|But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory. You know what tort theory is?|sv qy
B|No.|nn
A|Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Well, it, uh, an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.|% sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.|sv
B|Well,|%
A|If, if they have complications and,|sv
B|It depends.|aap_am
A|Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs, but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.|sd sd
B|Well, that's true, they are because doctors are performing many more tests. Many of them are unnecessary, they are doing so many C sections just to prevent.|aa sv sv sd
A|Just to prevent a a law suit.|sv
B|Because they have all these monitors now and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,|sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.|sv
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. See, I believe that there, there is a system already in place for health care.|b b sd
B|So, it's terrible. Uh-huh.|sd b
A|You know, they have indigent health care. You show up at Parkland bleeding|sv sd
B|You'll get it. That's true. In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.|^2 aa sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we have that happen. We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and at the last minute, they come to us. Well uh, we can't turn them away.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So,|%
A|Yeah, I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate.|b sv
B|Yeah. I'm for that. I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer, so I'd like to wipe them all out|b aa sd sd
A|Yeah. Well, I, I happen to know a few and I even claim one as a friend. He's a divorce attorney. But,|b sd sd sd %
B|He better not be mine|sd

A|Uh, he just said,|sd
B|They stop their O B at least.|sd
A|Yeah, I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever.|b sd
B|Right, Right.|b b
A|His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.|sd
B|That's incredible.|ba

B|They are human. Occasionally something will go wrong. Well, you can be human and Catholic.|sd sd sv

B|Yeah, no|b nn

A|Well, you know, who is getting rich? Insurance companies.|qw sv

B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah, and, um, I guess just, just the change, from the rat race.|b sd
B|Now, do you usually, like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around, or is it pretty much isolated.|qy qrr
A|No, it's, uh, it's pretty isolated, um, and to me, I like that, I guess, too, although there are people, I mean, you know, it's really hard to get away|nn sd sd sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I guess when, when we did sites in, in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to make it safe|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|but, I mean, we'd go in different parts of the ruins, and, and things like that. But we didn't even have tents there, we just sort of put out the sleeping roll|sd sd sd
B|Oh, good grief. That, that does sound neat, but I don't think I, I've got quite enough nerve to do that.

B|But at the same time I, I agree. I don't think we can do it and, and just, you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here.|sv sv
A|That's right. You know, we've got, uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.

And, you know, we need to solve these international problems but, um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.|aa sv sv sv sv sv sv

Uh, we really don't have too much of a problem as far as, uh, industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here. But we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain. coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.|sd sd sd sd sv
B|Right. Well, that's true. Actually down here we don't have a big problem with, uh, with air pollution. Mainly because we don't have anybody to to either side of us. Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes. I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in, uh, you know, debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution and their attitude's, basically, well, prevailing ins, winds are to the east so why should we have to worry.|b aa sd sv sd sd sd sd ^q
A|Yeah. I've, I've, uh, was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes. I mean you couldn't really see that much Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions|b sd sd sv sd
B|Oh, yes nothing,|b %
A|and then it gets hazy around here but they're really, we don't have a big problem with it. I think that, uh, what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is, it's, it's the, uh, ongoing acid rain problem. Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas where, you know, the lakes are becoming, uh, changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.|sd % sd sv sd sv sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I know that there's been battles over the states up here. Uh, you know, Governor Mario going after, you know, governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there. I remember when I was in Florida, the only problem was that it seemed like it may, it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh absolutely, yeah, just muggy. So, yes I think, yeah, I think you're right. Our most pollute substance down here is just water. But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place.|aa aa sv aa % aa sv sv sv

B|Absolutely.|aa
A|and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go. I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is, I think that's biggest problem because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.|sv sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really. Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything.|sd sv sd
B|That's, that's very true. Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere. But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry, you've got that, and you got the cars. I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean.|aa sv sd sd sd sv
A|Yeah. I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami, but I, I, uh, you know, Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh, but, you know, up here we have Kodak|b sv % sd sd

You don't know that, uh, you know You really, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over. Uh, to give you an example. My mom had an elderly cat who, uh, whoever evidently got a hold of it and, uh, the cat got sick. So she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died. So the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died and you owe me this bill, and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat So, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh, and she didn't get the cat back. So, yeah, they had to pay for all the medical, uh, bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses.

A|Uh-huh. Yes. In fact, it's funny, our vacations have always been, um, uh, uh, as, as they've gotten older.

B|You want to be around for the crisis and things like that, and, but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making|sv sv

B|Well, it the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons,|% sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't think it needs to be the mothers, but I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.|sv sv
A|Yeah, when they , you know it was funny, I can remember, and my mother and I have talked about it, to how important it was when I came home from school.|aa % sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|It wasn't really conversation, but there were always things that just tumbled out.|sd sd
B|Yes.|b
A|And, uh, uh, granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it, but it, when they, when it's not there they miss it.|sd % sv
B|I think that's true, but I I also think that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.|aa sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Even when I was there, my boys didn't share all that much with me, and certainly not to the extent I did with my mother.|sd
A|Yeah, yeah. No, I, I, I realize that, but it's funny, they don't always do it, but occasionally they do, and you want,|aa aa aa sd sv sv sv %
B|Yeah. Uh-huh.|aa aa
A|and when they do, there's a reason for it, that they're sharing it,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you want to be at least I've wanted to be available, when they, for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me. Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and it was, uh, you just felt, gee, if I weren't here, how,|% sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|or, or if my husband,|%
B|Who would they ask?|qh
A|That's right.|aa
B|Or what would they do?|qh
A|Yes, that's exactly right. Uh, but it has been, um, it's been interesting and particularly I, I think because the society in which we live, families are separated. You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles.|aa aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I mean, I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives.|sd
B|Yeah, well, I did too. We were close to my, uh, maternal grandparents, I mean, just a few miles, and, uh, close enough to visit my paternal grandparents, you know, quite often.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.|b b b
B|They were fifty miles away but,|sd %
A|See, and we're, uh, that, we, I, I grew up with, you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.|% % sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, and it was sort of an Italian family,|sd
B|Um.|b
A|um, but my children, we, although we have some relatives in the area that we, we see, we, they don't it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins.|% sd % sd
B|Right. Well, when my kids were quite small, uh, we lived close to both sets of grandparents|b sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they saw them a lot, but they don't have any cousins, uh, or they didn't,|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|their, uh, their cousins are about ten years younger.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, they never played together or anything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And there are only two of them and they didn't live in the same town.|sd sd
A|that the trend of, of families and time, where, where parents are spending less time, you don't have the families, too, to take up the gap.|% % sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|And so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that get the, the, the family issues that get discussed, and all these, I think are very important parts of them growing up,|sv
B|Yeah. Uh-huh.|b b
A|so we, we try to, to do it as well as we can. We keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and cousins and aunts and uncles, and we do, but it's, although it's not the same, we are, and that's part of, I think, teaching too, is what a family is like, because then how do they pattern their own?|sd sd sd sv qh
B|Well everyone makes its own model, but, uh, it seems that there should be some continuity,|sv sv
A|Yeah, Um.|b
B|and it's helpful to have, uh, things that become family traditions, and that sort of thing.|sv
A|That's, yeah. Well, we've always, we have had this tradition, um, that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree.|% % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had. Now, this year, it's, was hard with our son now being in college.|sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So this was one thing that we, um, weren't able to do this year, but we did that for from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until, uh, our older son went away to college.|sd sd
B|Oh, well, that's the kind of thing that they will remember, though.|sv
A|And we have advent calendars still, from the time that they came, you know, to,|sd
B|Uh-huh. Ours finally disintegrated.|b sd
A|Oh.|b
B|We had a felt one that was it was a Christmas tree that had, uh, a little trinket for each day, that was pinned on the date,|sd sd
A|Oh, yes. That's, uh-huh.|b % %
B|and then you took it off and put it on the tree, so at the end you had a decorated tree.|sd sd
A|Well, ours is, uh, a friend  uh, a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child.|% sd
B|And it finally got moth-eaten, we threw it way last year How nice.|sd sd ba
A|And, I mean, they look today as new as they did when they gave them to, she gave them to us, and there's a ring and you buy a present,|sd sd sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|and you wrap the present up, and I mean, the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things,|sd sd
B|How cute.|ba
A|to today, where, um, sometimes I put a little gift if I see something that's, uh, occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their, their future, to sometimes, just money, uh, pieces of candy.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|So, I think as they're getting in college, I just, for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day. Which was the equivalent|sd sd
B|Oh, I'm sure he appreciated that!|qy^d
A|well, it was the equivalent of a Christmas present.|arp_nd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it was, uh, and it was, and, you know, it was fun, but that's a tradition and they will, those will be passed on to them when they, when they get married and leave.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah. Well, you were saying what other trends are there, and one just occurred to me because I was editing a book about it recently,|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that is the trend in a lot of, uh, lower class areas, for the grandmothers to be raising the children.|sv
A|Yes, yes,|aa aa
B|And that's, a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs.|% sv
A|The yes, and the broken families. We, um, as I said, living in an area of Washington, D C. We definitely see this, uh,|% % sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, it's that grandmother figure, not only raising her own children, but raising, um, children from the streets, too, frequently.|sd
B|Right. Well, we had a sociologist at the center where I work who was writing a book on, uh, multigeneration, um, matriarchies, in a way. uh, where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother|aa sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and,|%
A|Yes, well, this is a, this is a uh, this is in fact, uh, we've been studying this in our school, that, um, this is one of the symptoms, or not the symptoms, it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing, it's a rite of passage|aa % % sd sv sv

B|I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening, but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain.|sd sd sd
A|Well, that's good.|ba
B|But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties. That's getting back to a little bit chillier.|sd sd
A|Yeah, that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year. I think, I haven't seen the the weather on the news in the evening lately, but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy.|b sv % sd sd
B|Yeah. I'm not certain either, but you're probably right.|b sd sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there. I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm. I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, that's true. Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.|aa aa sd
B|Um.|b
A|And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.|sv
B|Yeah. You're probably right.|aa aap_am
A|I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.|sd
B|Yes, as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago|b sd %
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know|sd
A|Right.|b
B|it wasn't just a super bad storm, but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time.|sd sd
A|Right. Yeah. One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.|b b sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead, and it was six degrees out.|sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature.|sd
B|Yeah, that, that is pretty unusual. And you really take notice of it, too.|aa sd sd
A|That's right. It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high. Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing. The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees.|aa sv sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away.|sd
B|Wow. I don't, don't like that super cold stuff.|ba sd
A|Nope.|aa
B|I just don't move very well when it's that cold.|sd
A|Yep, I, I'm really enjoying this now. Well, this has been interesting.|aa sd sv
B|Yeah, well.|aa
A|Not too challenging to the brain.|sv
B|Not, not a real in depth topic, but enjoyed talking to you.|sv
A|Nope. All right, Ellen, well you have a good day.|aa fo_o_fw_"_by_bc fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Why don't you go ahead and start.|ad
B|Okay. Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement. Uh, trial by jury is good but a lot of time a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness. And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me. I don't know.|aa sv sv sv qh h
A|So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?|qy
B|I think so.|na
A|You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student and, uh that's the sort of system they have.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well, they're like lawyers I guess. They're experts in the law|sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also. The judges do the questioning and, uh they,|sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh, but I'm not sure I like that I think I prefer the jury system myself.|% sv sd sd
B|You think you prefer the jury? You think your chances are better?|qy qy
A|Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury What, what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual. That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because, uh, anytime the government, uh, is the government against the individual you need you need the protection of ordinary citizens.|arp_nd sd sv
B|Well, that's true.|aa
A|I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a, a well I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that or, uh,|sv %
B|Well, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair. I mean even if, well the jury, I guess they do decide that but, but, I'm like you, in a case like that, most of the time its, I don't know, maybe I'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that. the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know, uh,|sv sv sd % h sv sv
A|Yeah. Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent. That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe.|b sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|Uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way, but I guess, I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it. Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.|sv sd sd
B|Oh really?|bh
A|I kind of like that system. Yeah.|sd %
B|Yeah. That's, that's not a bad system. But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit.|b^m ba sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in.|sv
A|Yeah. Right. And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.|b b sv
B|exactly.|aa
A|I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.|sd
B|Right, exactly.|aa aa
A|Insurance cases and things like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Where and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them  or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering|% sv
B|Uh-huh Exactly exactly.|aa aa aa
A|So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but,|sv %
A|Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time. Was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt?|sd qy
B|Yes, Yes,|ny ny
A|And it said that what, what do we, do we think that certain crimes should fit certain punishments, and, uh, I was thinking about it after I got off the phone, that, that I really, you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message to people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that, uh, those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment. Too often I feel that people get off, uh, without,|% sv sv
B|Yeah, I, I agree with you, although I will say, I'm not sure, you know, I sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have, you know, was, was because they were abused abused as children. And the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute, we didn't do anything like that you know,|aa aa h sd sv ^q
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|well, you know, forget that.|sv
A|Yeah, well, sometimes they even wonder when, when, uh, criminals plead temporary insanity for, for for crimes that are so severe and then, you know, they get sent to a mental institution|aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they play loony for a while, and then they're back out in public.|sv sv
B|Well, but I can't see that either. I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent uh, you know reason to not use capital punishment.|sd sv
A|Yeah. Yeah, oh, I agree, I agree, because we,|b aa aa aa %
B|I think, uh, I think if I wanted to badly enough, I could convince somebody, uh, I was crazy so, my family may say that on occasion, who knows|sv sd h
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, well, and too, you know, they can always be blaming the other person, well, she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child, or something, which I think is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse.|b aa aa sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh,|b b
A|I guess, you know, a lot of, and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and,|% sd %
B|That's the new one.|sd
A|Is that the new, I just happened to see the headline on it, and I didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what, but I thought, uh, you know, if these things, if children are being abused, I, I'm wondering how our school system is failing, that they're not even seeing this, you know, if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults, that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way, that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger, and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, to, to deal with that yet, but still.|% sd sd sd sv sd %

A|Yeah.|b

B|we would like the, uh, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, uh, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much. Huh-uh.|sd
A|Yeah. It's just, I mean, it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. *there they're|aa sv sv

B|Huh-uh. Yeah.|b b
A|I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a neighborhood.|sd

B|Yeah. Yeah. Breathing it, we're breathing it all the time.|b b sd
A|Yes. And, and how, if they have all of those, um, toxicity, I mean, it, there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and here you are living ...|b % sd sv
B|Huh-uh|b
A|That just doesn't make too much sense.|sv
B|No. And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste, no matter who does it. and they have shown, some of the industries have been real good at, uh, uh, doing their part in, uh, reducing the amount that they have, *sd|aa sv
A|Huh-uh. Huh-uh.|b b
B|Uh, they've reused some of it, uh, it can be recycled, a lot of their things,|sd sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and that they've shown, that it, uh, to begin with, apparently it does cost more,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|but, once they get started, it's really, it saves them money in the end, and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way.|sd sd

A|Well, how, how do you feel about the immigration laws?|qo
B|At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly the, uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction on the, uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion|% sv sv sv sv sd
A|Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.|b sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, we seem to, uh, to favor certain, uh, uh, countries particularly South American countries. And, uh, there is no, uh, uh, I have nothing, of course, against, uh, the, uh, the South Americans or, uh, or Hispanics, in that sense, but I think we, uh, are more restrictive of the, uh, so called eastern, uh, European countries than we, uh, we should be. Of course, that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe, so|b b sv % sd sv sd %
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, so I think, uh, you know, the, uh, embargo we placed on the, uh, on the Russian Jews, although we of, uh, spent years and years, uh, lobbying for their release and their ability to, um, immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred, we simply said that, uh, instead of the, uh, hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, uh, two thirds.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So.|%
A|Huh.|b
B|I do not quite go along with that, but|sd %
A|No, that doesn't make a whole of lot sense.|aa sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so, I'm a little touchy every now and then about that|sd sd

B|Well, I think in a way, though, uh, uh, I also have, uh, an opposite point of view, which is, uh, although I believe we should, uh, permit, uh, you know, constant immigration into this country uh, I think we should, uh, primarily for economic reasons, I think we should have, um, some quotas,|sv
A|Um.|b
B|of course, my family and I, again, again that was, you know, my grandparents came over during the time when, uh, there were quotas. So they had to wait, uh, you know, in, uh, certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over.|% % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, you know, but, uh I think unrestricted immigration, I think, is not, uh, is not best, uh.|% sv
A|Yeah. I, I, Well, I agree with that, I, I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the United States become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, I think it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that are, run out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries. I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their, their brand of crime.|b aa sv sv

There are, were some, uh, regulations over, I don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases cannot be excluded, uh, from, uh, immigration.

Uh, lot of money spent for, uh, things that are not used and, uh, I was, I was in the Air Force and I was at, there were, there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste.

A|And it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist, but, it could be put to more practical use.|sv sv
B|Yeah, and I, I think that, uh, it's a, a tone of our times that politicians, uh, are into themselves more than they are into, you know, doing something worthwhile for the people they represent, which is really unfortunate.|aa sv

I don't think the, you know, I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.

B|What is it that you are, you know, particularly upset about?|qw
A|Uh, I guess, uh, I think they've lost their compass and, uh, I'm not sure they know exactly what, uh, uh, public education supposed to be for anymore. But, uh, I voted with my feet and, uh, my kids go to parochial school.|sv sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a, the public school system?|qo
A|Well, one hundred percent of the, uh, customers care. That's one thing. Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting. And, uh, they, uh, take an active, relatively active part. Which, uh, I mean if you're, uh, sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, uh, watch what goes on and you, uh, uh, pay attention and participate and, and you can influence the way things are.|sv sv sv sv sv sv
B|So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes and, and, consequently, they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen?|bf bf
A|Yeah. The immediacy just isn't there.|aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, uh, I also think that one of the problems and, actually, I don't think this, I think this is a cultural problem. The, uh, problem with public education is really, uh, really a problem with the culture. And, I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California, for example, where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed. Uh, people are, uh, reluctant to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.|sv sv sv sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|I think that's a, a loss of civic virtue and a loss of, uh, uh, the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids. I think that's, uh, that's the principal problem is that, uh, people no longer see it as, uh, as their problem and there's an immediate problem.|sv sv sv
B|Right. It troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then  idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.|aa sv sv
A|Right. Yeah.|b b
B|Uh, it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision.|sv sv
A|Yeah. You know, I, I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States, which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution. Uh, you know, it barely made it. I think it was added afterwards I think the real, the principal was, uh, education for civic participation.|b sv sv sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes.|sv sv
B|Right. It has taken on a more profound, and you'd think we'd notice it, economic uh, thrust. Yeah.|aa sv sv b
A|Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. Now there seem to be really three reasons for education. One is education for civic duty. One is education for economic reasons. And one is education for civilization. I mean and I think that one,|sd sv sv sv sv sv
B|Well I'm glad that you added that one. Yeah, I think that one's significant.|sd % sv
A|That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion But, uh, the, uh, uh, now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is, uh, an economic enterprise to train people for jobs. And, uh, I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is. And I'm really sad to say this, I never thought I would have but I really think that, uh, the educational establishment has become part of the problem. And, uh, that's why I guess I'm sort of, reluctantly, uh, in favor of these, uh, choice programs.|sd sd sv sv sd sd sv sd
B|Right. Well I, I agree with everything that you've said so far and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact, I think, with public school teachers than perhaps you are, uh, except as a parent of your child and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned. But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related|aa aa sv sd sd sd

A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Uh, it was always my mother's fault, she was not, uh, sufficient, you know, she just was not good enough. What was wrong with her, was she not attractive enough, did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest. It was that kind of an attitude.|sd qh sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, first, my mother had always had a quote career, but always a career as a, uh, uh, in a secretarial position. She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in Des Moines, Iowa.|sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman, they expect me to be more motherly, they question my authority more, uh, than they ever would a man.

A|uh-huh.|b
B|So I am pretty, I am pretty pretty I mean, I am pretty aware of what goes on uh, in the church.|sd

A|Well, I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well, uh, Nickie. And I can, uh, relate to that, uh,|sv sd

A|uh, I think it's, it's the image that the woman has and, uh, in the world, as, uh, the lesser of the two.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Oh, always.|b aa
A|And, uh, I think things are changing, but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to, like it to take.|sv sv

A|And, uh, I think we are progressing at a snail's pace,|sv
B|Indeed.|aa
A|but we are progressing.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, that's the main point is that we are going ahead.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I think that, uh, in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve.|sv

A|And, uh, men, uh, have, a lot of them have, uh, come around and have seen, the error of their ways.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we have to, uh, face that reality also.|sv
B|I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change, why they can not bend. I mean, why they can not just accept, you know, competent women, I, I have never been able to understand that. I guess it's fear I mean what ,|sd sd sv %
A|It could be, if they are they are not sure of themselves.|sv
B|Sure.|aa

A|And, uh, I think that we are going to be, uh, on par with them in salary and in recognition, in the long term.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
A|Uh, and I, what I would like to see happen futuristically, is what we are discussing, is that yes, uh, we each have our, uh, jobs in life, and that we should recognize that. And that we should support each other.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b
A|And, uh, I think our problems would be fewer, if we supported each other. And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser, because we are equal.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Men have a lot of trouble with that though.|b b sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They, in their, in their own peer relationships, they do not treat themselves equal, and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals. They are, they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower. Uh, it just seems that, it seems, it seems that they are more comfortable that way. And I do not know if that's, I mean, that's, it's a militaristic point of view I guess, you know, somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry, but it's just really interesting to me. I am married to a wonderful man, you know, who treats me very, you know, with a, with as, I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time. But, when he gets angry, it's always over control issues, it's always over power issues, it's never over, you know, it's always, you said you were going to do something and you did not do it. As if he is the boss and I am the, you know, and I am the slave.|sv sv sv sv sd sv sv sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And it, those are the only, only issues we ever fight about. I think it's just, I think it's just difficult for men to, uh, to accept women equally, even if they want to, they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss Uh, dictator, dictatorships are real efficient.|% sd sv sv sv

A|And I believe that strongly.|sd
B|Um.|b

B|Um.|b
A|And I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict.|sv
B|Huh.|b
A|Uh, and I think that can happen in a very wonderful way.|sv

A|I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it.|qy
B|Uh-huh, oh, yeah. It has a stereo and a cassette player|ny ny sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon.|sd
A|That's incredible.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That is incredible.|ba
B|So.|%
A|Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight. The Audi does not have good mileage. That's the one drawback. It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh,|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky. Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two. It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's a, to me is a real drawback. I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight, but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning.|sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid.|sd
B|Uh-huh, it's really humid.|b sd
A|Yeah, uh, so air conditioning is uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer. Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know, power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,|aa sd sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it.|sd
B|Crank, yeah.|% b
A|Yeah, but, or, you know, if you want to have open windows, to be able to if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and.|b sd sd
B|Right. You don't have to stretch.|b ^2
A|But you know, I've lived all these years without them, I probably could have lived a little longer|sd sd
B|That's true.|ba
A|Uh, one of the things that we have, uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and those are really nice in good weather.|sv
B|That's right.|ba
A|So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes, I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, uh, just so it'd be a good solid car.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess that those are my major criteria. Everything else is, you know, a luxury, and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.|sd sv sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for?|qw
B|Um, like you said, anti-lock brakes and air bag, and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, you know, like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's,|sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah. Isn't that true. It's, it's funny, um, uh, that you use, the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable.|b b bh sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah, sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.|b sv
B|Yeah, they have parts, uh-huh.|b sd b
A|But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,|sv
B|Right,|b
A|and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, it I shudder. I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason. But I would love, I wish an American, an American, that, you know, engineering would make something as solid as a German car. You know, we certainly have the technology,|% sd sd sd sv
B|Right.|b
A|but, it's amazing, when we bought this Audi, I mean, everything is more solid in it.|sv sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, if, you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic|% sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know, and I, I, and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car. I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.|% sd sv

B|I know that there are many countries that, uh, are very successful with the operation of the government, uh, providing that plan.|sd

A|Uh-huh. That's the way with me, I don't know a whole lot about it. I that's the only concern I would have, because I think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care, and if you didn't have any choice on, you know, in who you go to,|b sd h % sd sv
B|Well I, Yes,|% aa
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or to change even, like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. There, that's one of my main concerns. I, I have a friend that has, their boy has been sick for several months, and they just have found out what's the trouble. And they have gone through, uh, one, two, three, four, five doctors and then a team of doctors, and they finally determined what the problem was. It took that long.|b b b sv b b aa sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yes, and the expense of that, yes.|b sv

B|Well, I would, I would think that they would have that as part, part of the benefit to the health care program, that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b
B|And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor, and hopefully that they would have their, um, accreditations there too.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. I guess that's, that's primarily was one of my thoughts, you know, because, you know how government is|b b sv
B|Yes, um, but those guidelines have to be set up, and I think they should be voted on by the public.|aa sv sv

B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right, yes.|b b aa aa
A|It, it would.|sv

A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b b b b b
B|Um, I'm not sure what else that, uh, we could address, uh, on health care, uh, other than the fact, I think, uh, the eyes and the ears and the, uh, whole self should be, uh, uh, included in all of that.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|Uh, dental, eye care, and, uh, our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be, um, undertaken in a program like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|Um, I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program.|sd
A|Uh-huh. I know where my son works they have, uh, an option right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company has elected|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that costs them less if they take the doctor that, uh, that the company has selected.|sd
B|And does he have an option uh, if he doesn't care for the personality?|qy
A|He Well, only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense.|% ng
B|Oh, I see|bk
A|Otherwise he you know, he has to take the physician that, uh, and the hospital that the company has chosen as their, you know, the one they have taken. And there again, I mean, he's gotten good service. He took the less expensive one of course.|sd sd sd
B|Well, if he's pleased with it, I guess that's, uh, the bottom line.|sv

A|Right, right. Yeah.|b b b

A|Um, I listen, I listen to a wide variety of music. Sometimes I'll turn on the classical music, in sometimes I'll listen to jazz,|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, every now and then country and western. Um, I'll listen to some of the rock stations. I also like the, uh, the, the classic rock stations, that play the older, more mellow type rock music and child in|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, some of the, some of the rock stations now are the, I guess the top forty stations or whatever. They just, it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and, sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating|sd % sd sv
B|Uh-huh. That's true.|b ba
A|and it gets kind of old, and they play the same songs over and over, and I just get kind of tired of all that.|sv sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So lots of times, I'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio, actually. But, uh, most of my cassettes, I guess, I don't, I don't like hard rock.|sd sd sd
B|No.|b
A|Um, I have some, some rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western. Some, uh, oh, I can't believe I can't think of his name. Um, Garth Brooks,|sd

A|I have a couple of his tapes. And, um, but it's mainly, it's mainly just the, the light rock type stuff.|sd sd
B|Yes, I don't, I never liked any of the heavy metal music|b % sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I never really listened to it because I, you know, I prefer to have more, I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, and I, back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty, and I listened to some of it,|% sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|but I, you know, now that there's just a million rap groups and, and, uh, they try to, tend to try to do, outdo each other with raciness, I think,|% sv sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and, so I, you know, I'm not attracted to that at all, but, um, it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access, and so now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, you know, if you go two or three years without having that, what I got the most exposure to|sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having a, you know, easy access to current music, and so I did, like I say, tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that I had, already had purchased.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|But we don't have a C D yet, do you?|sd
A|No, I don't. I sure don't because I have so many albums and cassettes I feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then start collecting C D and it just,|nn sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.|sd
B|Yeah, I, I kind of decided to wait until it, it was around a while. It was kind of like, remember when personal calculators first came out,|b sd sd
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|and they were really, really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars.|sd sd
A|Just like V C R's, too|sd
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|Yeah, I thought of that, too, that if I wait, it'll get a lot less expensive, and I can do without it for a while.|b sd sd
B|Sure and also they get better quality|ba sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they learn to have more features and things and without, and making them less expensive.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we're kind of waiting to, like, uh, now, you know, and the price of cassettes has gone down because C D are so popular,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so,|%
A|That's, and a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too, right now, I think. They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece.|% sd sd
B|I haven't even priced them. I guess they must be. Oh, really?|sd sd bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|That is awful|ba
A|Yeah I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have C D players. I thought, my gosh,|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while.|sd
B|Take our time.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Right.|b
B|Well, I can't imagine, um, you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as like a cassette player, where if you heard something, you could record it, you know. Uh, if you have, I guess, if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something, that you'd heard or that you owned an album of,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|so C D won't be nearly as handy.|sv
A|Yeah, see, I've got a, on my stereo I've got a, a, uh, turntable, and then I've got a dual cassette so I can record off other cassettes.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I never realized you couldn't record onto I just never really thought about it because I haven't really looked into it very much. I don't have one and,|sd sd sd sd %
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I've never really looked at one very closely, but that, that would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car. Now I guess, you know, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will probably have C D players by then,|sd sd sv
B|Yes.|b
A|but, uh, I'm not planning on doing that for a while. I just got mine paid off|sd sd
B|Enjoy it.|ad
A|I'm going to stick with the cassettes and, and, uh, you know, until, until they, now my sister, my younger sister has a, she does have a C D player that she got for Christmas and she's got the, the cassette, so she can record off cassettes onto C D I mean, I'm sorry, other way around, off C D onto cassettes.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|Um,|%
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|so I can record some things from her and, you know, get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if I want to but but, uh, I just haven't gone to C D yet.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh. Why, we haven't either, but we, you know, we like the, the idea of having great extra quality, you know, in your music and things.|b sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, but I'm satisfied to just have what I've been used to, not have to think about the great financial sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all C D or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children, um, I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching, and what kind of music I was listening to and activities|sd
A|Right. Uh-huh.|b b
B|because, um, you know, I just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things, and a lot of the, lot of the songs have some lyrics that, um I just wasn't pleased with, you know.|sd sd
A|Oh, yeah And they get worse and worse, too.|b sd
B|Uh-huh. And so I really think we've tried to tone down our taste there to make, uh, you know, our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life.|b sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, that's amazing how I used to, when I was in college, I used to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something,|b b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but ever since I've been out of college, I guess over the last several years, I listen to the stereo less and less. Now I, I will turn on, I've got a small jam box in my bathroom. I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, so I'll turn the radio on and, and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because, again, there's, you know, there's nothing else going on.|sd sd
B|Right.|b
A|I might as well listen to the radio while I'm driving to work.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But other than that, I've, I really don't, I don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore. I guess I'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what I want to listen to, and put it on the, on the turntable. I don't know, I just don't, don't bother to do it very much anymore.|sd sd sd sd
B|Yes, I know what you mean. I, I know my husband, he, um, plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school|b sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music, and he goes out of his way to play marching band music, or like you say, jazz or classical to the children to, to give them some exposure to different kinds of music.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds and,|sd %
A|That's good. What instrument does he play?|ba qw
B|He plays the, it's a euphonium. It's like a small, a really small, not a tuba, but I it's hard to explain|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I never had known anyone to play one before.|sd
A|Uh-huh, I've never heard of that.|b sd
B|But it's kind of like a small, small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's a cross between a tuba and, and an, and, you know, a horn. It's a brass instrument.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So he plays that and, and a little bit of piano and but he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and he thinks that would be good for the kids|sd
A|Uh-huh, oh, I'm sure it is. I'm sure it is. I was exposed to a lot of music when I was younger. I, my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years,|b sv sv sd % sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, so I was, I was a real good piano player, but then I got interested in a lot of other things and I got real involved in many things and, and now I don't have a piano in my apartment or anything. I could sit back down and play a few things, but not like I used to be able to.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.|sv

A|Well, you're, you're just a youngster then|sd

A|So, you think we're ready?|qy
B|I think I'm ready|na
A|Okay okay. Uh, you want to start off?|bk bk ad
B|Well, let's see, the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh, since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby uh,|aa ^h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change.|sv
A|Very much, yeah, yeah.|aa b
B|Very much, and I think you'll have to agree and and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties,|aa sv sd
A|Yes. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
B|and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical, it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.|sv sd
A|I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, they come in that way.|sv
B|And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's okay and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much. So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,|sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then the women change around them.|sv
A|I hadn't thought much about that, but that is true. That,|sd ba %
B|Uh, I think men are trying.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Some of them.|b sv
B|But they don't have a national organization of men,  to, uh, help them out|sv
A|No.|b
B|and uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,  where both team, it has to be a team partnership now,|sv
A|Very much. Uh-huh.|ba b
B|and they both have to work|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they both have to raise the children,  if we're going to have any kind of future at all,|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, the me, oh, I don't know, the, the yuppiedom,  the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers|% h sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they wanted to compete with men, they wanted to be like men,|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's wrong.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men|sv
A|Not, no, they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.|% b sv
B|Absolutely, and so that's, you know, they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,  that they've had to, you know, restructure,|aa % sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day, I got to get some for all my men friends, it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do|sd sd sd
A|There you go There's a lot of truth in that.|ba ba
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, we shouldn't, we were made differently,  however you come to that conclusion, we were biologically, physiologically, made differently and there is great wonderment,  in that, and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other so,|% sd sv sv sv %
A|Yes, it shouldn't be destroyed.|aa sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah, yeah.|b b
B|And, and, you know, just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing,|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|it's, it's viva la difference  someone said that|sv
A|Yeah, yeah. Yeah.|b b b
B|and I think that you can truly respect the other person, I mean, you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know you know. Depends,|sv sv %
A|Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. You know.|sv
B|Yeah. Well that depends on what day of the month it is.|b sd
A|Yeah|b
B|But, uh, I don't know, I guess we've gotten more of a, in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles,|h sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles and,|sd %
A|I think now when both are working they have a more more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.|sv
B|Yeah, well, that's, that's a very different way to do,|b sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,  raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,|sv
A|Right. Right. Yeah. Because you get set in your ways and it's,  really hard because to, to really to get help. Uh, you know to get the work load shared.|b b b sv sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I just love the babies|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah. Have you been that way long?|b qy
B|Just eight years, just|ng %

B|Yeah, it has been.|aa sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but that's another story.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps, I mean I, I couldn't ask for a better life.|sd sd
A|That makes a big difference. Uh-huh.|sv b
B|I mean if this is the way it had to be,  this is the best way,  I could possibly do it|sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|and, and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things that really,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort,  of thing|sd
A|Yes.|aa
B|and,|%
A|Well, probably your role and, and the way you are also has changed, though. You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.|sv sv
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. I mean, boy, I mean I, I would have had so, I had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place, you know,  where I couldn't do a lot of things and, uh, just adjusting to that,  that, uh, yeah, that was a major change,|ba b ba ba sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b b b b b

A|The best you can, yeah.|b^m
B|they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there, I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.|sv sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she doesn't know who she is and she's,|sv %
A|So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|or they say they do anyways, and, but I think ones that don't have to, the, it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.|sd sv sv
B|Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.|sv
A|Well, that could be.|ba
B|Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south you know, a woman's role is,  a woman's role,  sort of thing,|sd

B|And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,  with the good old boys,  here in Texas sort of thing,  making career moves|sv
A|Yeah. Right. Right.|b b b
B|but, Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years. I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.|sv
A|Right. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.|b b b b
B|That's the woman's role,|sv

A|Yeah, yeah.|b b

Uh it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff.

A|and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized. But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever.|sd sd sv
B|Yeah, whatever. Yeah.|b ^2 b
A|Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what. I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that.|sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, also there's aspect of cost and I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, uh, the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what. You know, being that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know. But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay.|sv sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, whether it's, I think it's with pay. If I remember, jury duty is with pay.|% sd sd
B|Well, And, and I'm, I, I'd, I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work. But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid.|% % % % sd sv

A|Hi, Kay.|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|I, uh, was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh, was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job.|qw
B|Uh-huh. Well, um, I, we just recently graduated from Rice University, and, uh, we were going through a lot of job interviews and things, and some of the things that were important to me, uh, when my husband was looking for his job, was, um, hours, you know, we, he'd been in graduate school so I was used to his not being home at all|b sd sd sd % sd
A|Yeah|b
B|So I was, you know, didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and you know, even on the weekends and, um, and things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So that was important to me, and also insurance for the our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it.|sd
A|Sure. Yeah, I don't ever want to have to worry about that. That's real important to me. Um, you know we have that, that Aetna|b b sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that's what we, the insurance that we have right now.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Us, too.|b sd
A|When we were in Colorado, they had, um, a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was, um, not that kind of H M O where you have to go to their, their sort of like clinics, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but this was just an H M O where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that, but it was with a certain list of, of doctors that, you know, participated in the H M O,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um you know, then you only had to pay the,|sd
B|Well, that's nice.|ba
A|for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor, and, uh, three dollars for the prescriptions.|sd
B|Uh-huh, that's good.|b ba
A|And, uh, I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That, those prescriptions can be very expensive.|sd
B|Oh, I know. We just went through that ourselves. We just, you know, are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things.|ba sd sd
A|Oh, I know, especially if you get, what is it, Seclor I think that that just about breaks the bank right there.|ba sv
B|Uh-huh. Yes. Yes, it's pretty bad. Well, yeah, and we, um, we were interested in having dental insurance, too, because, um, having been in school, we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff|b aa aa sv % sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over|%
A|Do, Do you have the basic plan or do you have the, the other one?|qy
B|and, We have, um, you know we're at Aetna with an, uh, we have like the the dental insurance is separate. Is that what you mean?|% sd sd sd qy
A|Right.|na
B|I don't think it's the basic, I think it's the other one.|sd sd
A|The one that's like you get additional, they'll pay a little bit more I think for the different procedures.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|We just have the basic right now, and for most things it tends to cover it We don't too many major, um, expenses at this point, but we have been able to find dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays. A couple of times we've had to pay, oh I don't know, three to five dollars but that's not that bad.|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh. No, that's great. Yeah, we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too. Yes and, let's see, besides insurance, other things that we looked at, um, well, my husband does not like to commute very far,|b aa ba b sd b ^h sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and we don't like him to be, you know, having to drive an hour to work or something|sd
A|No, we don't like that either|aa sd
B|So we kind of looked for where, where the, uh, his office would be located and well, he's at, you know, he's at the one that's at, um, seventy-five at, uh, six thirty-five and so we, by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away.|sd sd
A|Is his office in Plano? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, that's not bad.|qy b b b
B|Um, especially when they finish all the construction out here|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and we didn't want him to let, you know, to, like we had some job offers in the New York area, and we thought, well, you know, he would be really commuting|sd sd sd
A|Oh, yes, you're not kidding.|ba ba
B|and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.|sv
A|That's right.|ba
B|And, um, so, that was something that was important to us, and, because, like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have, you know, made us be more together, and, and what other, can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and,|sd sd sd % qy %
A|Well, those are some of the things that are very important to us too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, we, we'd like, you know, other benefits that are provided, um, the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of I think that's, that's pretty nice,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though, we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or, or any of that. But that's, that's a nice benefit to have.|sd sd sv
B|Uh-huh, that's true. That's really important. Um, also, what, um, opportunities there would be for advancement, I think, we looked at besides just, you know, what salary you would be having now. But when, when could, uh, your salary increase|aa ba sv sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|um, is there, was there somewhere to go.|sd
A|Yeah, that's, that's one of, I think, the hard things right now, I mean they're going through some tough times to say the least.|b sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I know many of us are thankful that he still has a|sd
B|Yes, that we can make our mortgage payments and, yeah, that's really true.|aa ^2 aa ba
A|um, if, if an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often, in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing. A lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with|sv sv sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and things like that, that's one of the things that, that happens when someone, when you're dealing with a large company.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But.|%
B|But, we also were interested in, um, you know, being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so that you would feel happy going to work every day and Rather than thinking Oh, I really, I can't stand these people.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, so that's something that was important to him, in thinking he could work under. Oh, just since last summer.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's only been, not even a year yet, so.|sd %
A|Well, I was going to say it sounds like you, you picked out a lot of good things, you know, for him, to, to, uh, to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it. In a big company, though, you also get moved around a lot|sv sv
B|Yes, well.|b
A|He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Or we may be having to drive to Plano, you never know.|sd sv
B|You never know, we're hoping that that won't be the case We, I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, um, this area is that, um, my husband was raised in Irving|b^m sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so he, we have a lot of family here, his side of the family. And being, when we were down in Houston, we were isolated, I mean, it's not that far, but, people would we didn't have anyone in town that was our family.|sd % sd sd sd
A|Right.|b
B|And although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things, um, we were anxious to move close to family members, just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that.|sd
A|Yeah. We're very,|b sd
B|So, that really made a big difference, I think, in why we chose T I, and chose to move this way.|sd
A|We're very far from our families, and it's really hard. I have little children, and, um, they were the only grandchildren, and so, our, our families are, are really far away. In fact, this is a little off the topic, but yesterday, my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to, back to Chicago|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it stopped in Dallas for half an hour, so I loaded the kids in the car, and we went downtown, and met her train for half an hour, and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and I think it, it made her trip a little bit nicer.|sd sd %
B|Oh, that's nice. Yeah, and it is, I think it is important to, you know, want to be close to your family and,|ba b sv %
A|Yeah, and it's, it's hard, I mean, just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us.|aa ^2 sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, um,|%
B|Yeah, that's the same, way we felt.|% sd
A|it's nice. It's nice that you can have your family close like that.|sv
B|We're really enjoying it. I wonder what it would be like, I mean, I wanted to be close to family, but I also thought it would be harder to be close to family.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, sometimes it can be.|aa sd
B|But it's turned out really good, and I think that, you know, we're really satisfied with that choice, and we, you know, kind of felt like, um, it was worth it to us.|sd sd sd
A|That's good.|ba
B|But anyway. Well, I, my children just ran out the door, so I need to go check on them|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc sd

A|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Okay. Did you want me to go ahead?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc qy
B|I'll let you go ahead and start, yeah. of that kind of stuff|aa
A|Okay. Well, one thing, I, I guess both of us are very much aware of the equality. Uh, it seems like women are, uh, just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in, uh, jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did. Uh, it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes, making supper, or taking care of the kids or uh, the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which, uh, they did everything. They went to work and they took care of the family, so. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.|bk % sv sv sv % sd sd sd % aa aa b
B|but my husband is wonderful.|sd
A|Yeah, that's the way my husband is too. I mean it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes.|b sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It doesn't bother him at all to do the laundry verses, uh, men from way back. There is that, well, if you did that you were henpecked or whatever. But, men are starting,|sd % sv sv
B|Yeah, yeah. There are still some that aren't cooperating but|b b sv %
A|Yeah, those are very few. I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want.|b sv sv
B|They're not accepting that anymore.|sv
A|Right, exactly.|b aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it's, it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything, uh, you know, and then kind of real light pay. There's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all. So it's, it's kind of a, uh, neat thing to see as far as equality in the households, and I think that's even going to get better. Even, you know, even more so.|sv sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this. It will be, uh, hopefully for my daughter who I instill into, it doesn't matter if you want to drive a truck, honey, or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse, it doesn't matter if you want to be, uh, the President, or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor, it doesn't matter. It's what you want to be. So I have always instilled into her, and I think mothers, um, are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say, hey, you don't have to stay with nursing, you don't have to be a secretary, you don't have to be,|sv % sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
B|Yeah. Well, I feel like, um, to an extent that is really important, you know, that, that, um, it is important for women who need to work uh, or are in a position that they want to that they can do that.|b sv
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. If they want to, right. Uh-huh.|b b ^2 b
B|Um, but I also think it is important for them to be with the children.|sv
A|I do too.|aa
B|I, I think there, there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men.|sv
A|You know, there's a certain part of me, Uh-huh.|sd b
B|And there are some things that men are designed to do better than women.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't think it should ever be totally equal.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know that's not, uh, we're not made like that.|% sv
A|Well, emotionally I think, uh, women do a little bit, uh,|sv
B|That's right.|ba
A|I, I think that's, the gap is coming closer as, um, what I've learned in, uh, just, just being out there. It seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings, and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage, talk about manhood, talk about what they didn't have with their fathers.|sv sv sv sv
B|Huh.|b
A|Are expressing more emotions, learning what emotions are. It may be in the future that men, you know, some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves. Um I, I know of some mothers that I, I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding, more, um, low key, more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised, you know, to develop whatever skills that they have,|sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and some of the men are developing, uh, very good too. So, it may come down to where it's, it's individual basis. Where everybody is treated an as individual, and not by sex.|sv sv
B|Yeah. Yeah.|b b
A|If you want to stay home and take care of the kids, honey, that's fine. I will go out and make the, uh, take care of the, uh, money making. And it, it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that.|sd sd sv
B|One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, and for some it's not a problem, but there's more and more, it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income.|sv
A|On one income, uh-huh.|^2 b
B|It can be done,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but you make sacrifices.|sv
A|Yeah, that,|b %

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, then I moved to North Carolina and I, I didn't camp for a long time, and then I started to, uh, go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting, so, I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting.|sd sd sd sd

We don't collect any of that and that, that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.|sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd

A|It's, it's really not that much trouble. We keep a large plastic, uh, just a, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.|sd sd

A|You know, , um, I read a book one time or a a magazine article and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution but it's not. If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.|sd sd sd sd
B|Really.|b

B|Uh, I think that, uh, really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service. Uh, and, you know, I mean, there have been so many people that have done it and I've talked with several and I think they've gotten a lot out of it.|sv sd sd sd

A|What about, when, when would people do it, when they finished high school?|qy
B|I think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, if they go straight into college I think they're going in too quick but,|sv %
A|I think particular boys that the maturity, in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school and I think there's a, there's a real challenge there. There's also this, this issue of, of, uh, you know, whether you're really ready, and I think it gives a different perspective.|sv sd sd sv sv
B|Right, uh, I, I think if you've been out of school a year, year and a half, before you start to college, you appreciate college more, than someone that just goes right straight into college.|b % sv
A|The only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this?|qw
B|Well, a lot of parents fund their children. There are, uh, some groups that have their children, you know, go away for a year. Even the religious organizations.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, I think the Mormon church has, sends out missionaries that,|b sd
B|Right. And the parents fund them for the whole year, year and a half that they're gone.|b sd
A|That's, uh, it's interesting. It gets them away from home and, and gets them to do something useful, although the kids today, though, it, it seems that almost that their concern for money, I, we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in, in trying to find a job, study something that will give them a job as opposed to, be curious, be curious as to if, if there was, if there was mandatory, you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary, do you think that would be reasonable?|ba sd sd sd % sd qy
B|I think it would. In, in Israel, the, even the women are, are required to, to be in the military for a certain period of time. Uh, I was in the military, and I personally feel if, if they have the draft, that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men.|na sd sd sd
A|Well, but, the, the issue of, of, of, which, what, what would, what would you find, what would you have them do? You know there are a lot of people around with, there's a lot of unemployment right now. What would you have these people do if they were brought in?|% qw sd sd qw

A|We were very heavy into that. Other than that, they were pretty much, and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.|sd sd sd

A|Right.|aa
B|like my son is in, uh, Little League this year. He's ten. And they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, I don't know, there would be no way to do it.|sd sd sd sd sv

A|So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was, it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience, but it took our total time. I did not work, uh, when I did this. Now I do work full-time.|sd sv sv sd sd sd sd

B|So what's the conditions like in Dallas?|qw
A|Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver. I grew up in Denver, and, and I've lived there most of my life, and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days. Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down, probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Um.|b
A|Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.|sd
B|Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable.|sd

B|I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary.|sv
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, it, it becomes, uh, maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is.

B|Yeah, yeah. But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was grand. And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them, but there was quite a few lakes all around there. It seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where I was.

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap, but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every, they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.|sd sd sd

B|Well, I went to, I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more and I, I went after it and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.

B|yeah, I, I think I need to, uh,|ny sv

B|I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.|sv

A|And we just have a ball, and we play three days in a row, three different courses and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five. So,|sd sd sd %
B|Oh, yeah, if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.|aa sd
A|You bet, so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.|aa sd
B|Yeah, yeah, I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better, I, I, I get through the ball better. Uh, and I also, if I, I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.|aa aa sd sd sd % sd
A|You bet.|aa
B|And I, my control is a little bit better there.|% sd
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Uh, so,|%
A|That's super. I haven't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of, I'm always wanting to hit it hard and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball, and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone, when I do swing it's an easier swing|ba sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I do, actually, hit the ball better.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?|b qy
A|No, I have a two through, you know, two through wedge. I hit a two iron awful lot. Off, now, off the tee.|nn sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't hit a driver off the tee. That, that's why I need my driving lessons.|sd sd
B|Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too, and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.|sd sd
A|That helps.|ba
B|Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh, I sacrificed distance, but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.|sd sd sd
A|Well, that's, that's a good idea. I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more and I'm going to do the same thing. I, I laid off my woods about three years ago and I just use a two wood off the fairway and I'm a fairly strong person so I get a pretty good little drive|sv sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know, if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.|sd sv
B|Oh, yeah, absolutely.|aa aa
A|And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.|sd sv
B|Yeah, well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more. If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice uh, range.|b sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I think there is less frustration factor there, too, uh,|sv
A|Makes good, makes good sense.|ba
B|So, but I, I, the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start. Apparently they're very difficult to play with, but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too. And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron, it's incredible.|% sd sv sd sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it. And I, and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with. He has used a lot, and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron. Uh, distance iron.|sd % sd sd sv
A|You bet. My my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be great after that That, boy, I just, if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know|ba sd % % sd

Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case. The coverage on that was, you know, when it first happened it was, he was guilty, he was guilty, he was guilty. You know, they try to have you form opinions or whatever, and then I, I didn't like the the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that.

B|This is one of the more established neighborhoods,|sd
A|Huh-uh. That sounds real interesting. I live in a suburb of Dallas and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home. So, at least, I have two bathrooms. That's not so bad, but, uh, it's pretty typical for the area, as well. Uh, I've always been interested in older homes, personally. So, I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like. What about yard space? Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?|b ba sd sd sd sv sd sd sv qo qy
B|The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.|sd

We have a very small yard and, um, I do have garden, but it's extremely small, but, uh, it seems like, though, for your area that, that is sort of different. In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house.|b ba sd sd sd sd sv sv
B|Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.|sd
A|That's exactly right. That's the way we are. We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back. So we have, we have quite a few parties, and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone. So, uh, that's true that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together. But, uh, you know, it's fine for now, hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home. The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small. You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that, so. Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home? Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger is that true?|sv sd sd sd sd sv sd sd sd sd sd % qy sv qy

A|and I renovated a house there and that was so much fun. I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline and, uh, was considered typical for that area. So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it.

I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that, so, the only thing that I use is soap. I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them. But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant, so I hate to spray them with anything.

B|And, but I know how much I have to bring in a month And that's about it. That's about as far as we go. And then anything extra is, you know, more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day|sd sd sd sd

A|Oh dear.|ba

A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation.|sd sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit.

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And seems to me that that's, I think that's the way it's done now. Uh, at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good.|sv h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it and I, I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is for a particular thing.|sv sv
B|Uh-huh. And, I guess, also what the system will absorb|b sv
A|Right.|b
B|Probably more tuned in to that. Possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty|sv sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole, I mean he could have like a personal prejudice. You know, judges are people like everybody else  even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial|sd sv sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|but maybe, uh,|%
A|And I think that may, I, that may be an exception as well. Because I think that, doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than, than the judge?|sv % qy
B|I, I think that's, I think that's the way it is.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty. Do they have a death penalty in California?|sd qy

A|the, uh, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not.|sd

A|You know, it's someone who had, uh, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.|sd
B|Yeah. I, something like that, I've got no problem with it. Uh|b % sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I guess the way I think about it is not, it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people|sv sv

B|put it to sleep, you know. Just get it out, you know, it's not able to fit in, you know|ad ad sd
A|Something inexpensive.|bf
B|Yeah. Yeah, exactly Uh, I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just, if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty, they got the death penalty, they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years.|aa aa aa sv sd sd sv sv
A|Yeah. I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.|b sd

A|But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and  you'd hate to be one of those.|sd sv
B|Yeah. Oh, I'm sure Yeah.|aa aa b
A|The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all the, all verdicts,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|well maybe not. I don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be  unanimous.|ar sd sv
B|I believe it is  in capital. I think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever How ever many is on, sitting on a jury.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I I believe that's the way it is. But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh|sd sv
A|Yeah. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other eleven.|b sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|And, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.|sd sd
B|Oh, no|ba
A|the judge told them  they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet|sd

A|Uh-huh. What do you think you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?|b qw
B|Well since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, uh, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. *spelling wined should be wind|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|a seating room. How about you?|sd qo
A|Well, I think the next car we get will probably be a well I, I like Buicks. We have a Buick Century now, it's a nineteen eighty-seven|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, whatever I get, I want to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over, so I think the four door is probably a major requirement|sv sd
B|Sure.|b
A|and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car. Uh, you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh|sd sd
B|Sure.|b
A|something that will carry it around careful, I guess is best, best way to describe it. Right now, we've got a V six and it, that seems to be just fine. I know they they're coming out with some V eight now and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.|sv sd sv sd sv
B|Yeah, I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back, so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.|aa sd sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.|sv
A|Right. I, uh, I drive a, a truck, a Ford truck. I, I like trucks because they're spacious, and it's handy to haul things. Uh, it's not related to my business, I just really use it, basically, for transportation, but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that, and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.|b sd sd sd sd sd sd sv
B|Sure. Is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.|b qy
A|Traction? Uh, not really, uh, you know, it's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway|br ng sd sv
B|Actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it, yeah. We, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago.|sv % sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car, and, this is a rear wheel drive model. So, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.|sd sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Haven't had any problems since.|sd
A|What kind of, what make is the mini van?|qw
B|It's a Mazda.|sd
A|Mazda, I see.|b^m bk
B|And, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability. Fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van, but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around|sd sd sv sd
A|Right.|b
B|so we've been able to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon.|sd
A|One of my sons has a, a Plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess|sd
B|Uh-huh. Right.|b b
A|and, uh, they have a, a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and, and their stuff, and, of course, as he gets friends, I'm sure that will be even handier. So, I know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.|sd sd sv sd
B|Yeah, I think that we're going to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years to come. Probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway.|b sv sv
A|What about, uh, all wheel drive? Is that something that you'd be interested in or is that,|qw qy %
B|Uh I'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And even as, as light as that is with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|So I know I'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door. You know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,|sd sd
A|Uh, being a former drug user I, uh, I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it.|sv
B|Whoa. Uh-huh.|ba b
A|Uh, because I know that, uh, in using drugs I was not a good employee.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh, whenever you are an employee of the company, you are using its assets, and, uh, you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp.|sd sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases|sd
B|Where do you work? Oh.|qw bk
A|And, uh, it's also a retreading plant, and that's where most of our, uh, injuries occur.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident. Then he's automatically, uh, given a drug test.|sd sd
B|Right. Do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident, or is it?|b qy %
A|Yes, when he goes to the doctor the first time.|ny sd
B|Yeah.|b

B|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
A|Now we've let some people go, uh, that we, was found that drugs were used in their system. Now, I don't know how T E C would handle it. They haven't pursued it, you know.|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, if there's some, uh, problem I know, there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines, and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,|sd sd sd

A|Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?|qy
B|Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting, because when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that, but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.|na sd sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because they're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I, I think that drugs, they do test for drugs in that capacity, but it's not their exclusive, it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.|sd sd sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business?|sv qw
B|Well, it's actually, uh, we do oil well services. So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies, and they go out to, we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff, so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything, but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and, a software engineer|^h sd sd sd sd sd sv
A|Um.|%
B|and I work in the software, uh, house, and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.

In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you, and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.|sd sd sd sd h sd sv sd sd

B|Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that, but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol, and they didn't find any problem with that, you know, but,|sd sd sd sd %
A|Right.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. they'll have these little parties, and people will just get, I mean, I've, my brother lives where I work, and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know. And, uh, uh, but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,|sd sd sd % sd sd sd
B|Yeah|b
A|but, uh, I think drug testing, and I, I don't know, I guess I I think it's got some relevance, but I think its relevance is pretty limited. I mean, I think, you know, in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.|sv h sv sv sv sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.|sv
B|Yeah, it's really, it's really bizarre. Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know. I, I, there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle and she, she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and, I don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know, they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway|b sv sd % sd sd sd h sd sd sv sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test and, and it's, it was kind of a long story, but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through, and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews, I'm not even working for this company, I'm going in for, like, interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical, you know, and, uh, actually beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening, but I had forgotten about that, and so, basically, I'd already peed off that morning and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample, and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,|sd sd sv sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd sd
A|Oh. Right.|b b

A|So, what kind of music you into?|qw
B|Well, I have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music. In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.|sd sd
A|The opera, yeah, it's right on track. I like classical, but I can't deal with opera at all. And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy. I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that.|aa sd sd sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it's, it's got to have a point to it.|sd
B|Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to, but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you, is, uh, gets a little annoying.|sd sv
A|Yeah. What kind of progressive stuff?|b qw
B|Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know, I'm thirty, so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and R E M, that sort of stuff.|sd sd sd
A|uh.|%
B|Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point, and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.|sv sv
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's, a lot of people like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.|aa aa sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think that's pretty much, you know, bull. Because R E M really hasn't changed. If, it's, it's interesting. They're producing, uh, similar music and it's good music|sv sv sv sv sv

B|I think it is.|aa
A|I'm impressed.|sv
B|Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it. I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton. Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he, he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes.|sv sd sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.|sv
A|Uh, but he picked the right songs and and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.|sv sv
B|I guess. That, and a marvelous hairdo.|aa ^2
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that, that that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop. I'm I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop. It just seems like there's no, no real point. You hear the same, same tune over and over again in a thousand guises|aa aa sv sv sd sv sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,|%
B|Well, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I like a lot of classical music, but I also dislike, uh, some classical music, and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music, and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time.|sd sd sd

A|Oh, yes.|aa
B|Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh, for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition|h sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's interesting music, but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic, uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive. You know, we're, we're, much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth, that's right, you know, we'll do, we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it|sv sv ^q ^q ^q ^q
A|It's safe.|^2
B|and it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me. Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,|sd sv
A|You want to start?|qy
B|Well, I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore, having seen the last generation, I guess it puts me in, you know, gives me a perspective on that.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.|b b
B|Uh, I, am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women in, both in society and in the work place, uh, there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office, but not necessarily. Uh, now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples, uh, are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will, uh, have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed.|sd
A|I agree, uh, the equality of, uh, the roles now between the sexes, I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war, especially compared with, uh, the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men.|aa sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I have wondered why they allowed, or let, you know, both the father and mother go, uh, and the children are left without either parent. Now to me that's kind of a drawback. But, uh, I guess it's a price you pay. And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the, uh, uh, day care centers.|sd sd sd sv sd
B|Wonder about them in what way?|qw
A|Well, uh, from what I understand there's been studies that, uh, these children are, uh, more rebellious. Uh, they term it as more, uh, creative. But, uh, that they, uh, are much more contentious.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I, I don't, I, I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up, you know, in a, uh, kind of a, uh, community, rather than a home.|sv
B|Uh-huh. I have not, to be honest, had much experience, with children in that situation.|b sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, I guess one knows one's own storly and I know, uh, in my children's case it was one where, uh, pretty much up until the older of two was in, uh, let's see, I guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force.|sv sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh|%
A|So they,|%
B|so I guess my experience is, is just with what we did and, and so they didn't really go through the child care route.|sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|They were able to be home together. Uh, and we never actually experienced that. What, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, I guess I anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|uh, I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of, of surrogacy that we see. I just don't know.|sd h
A|What do you mean?|qw
B|Uh, deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|bk
B|Sort of rent-a-mom, to be, you know, not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, person. For instance, that,|sd sd
A|Yeah. That's strange. A nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b ba qy^d b b
B|and I could, you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that. In fact, I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession.|sd sv
A|That's right, that's right.|aa aa
B|Uh, I, I don't have a, other than, than a reading and, and male perspective on, on the on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not. Uh, I know that, that my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent. I, I don't know that I, uh, felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs.|sd sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't have boys, that doesn't, didn't bother me, never has. Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or, or as a professional nanny, nanny as you put it, uh.|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care.|sv
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
B|It would be a sort of day care, but it would be more of a family setting.|sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I know that there are young people, characterized, I guess as being half my age, so that by definition that means, they're young. Uh, that, in my work place, who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child,|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. To come in and live with them?|b b qy^d
B|I could easily envision that. Pardon?|sd bf
A|To come in and live with them?|qy
B|Or to put their child into a into a home setting, where they would, you know, like they, they would get, leave at eight in the morning and, and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and you were paying for really high quality care.|sd
A|Yeah. Right.|b b
B|Uh, I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on, on the order of what I quoted to someone, because that's what the experience they want and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that, that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh. And then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.|b bf
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|I know the day care centers are not cheap either. You know they're,|sd %
B|I haven't ever really looked at them. Are you aware at all, of, of what they would, what they cost?|sd qy
A|Uh, well, no, I just know, I know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it. They have to go with the, a single, uh, I mean a baby-sitter more, more or less.|nn sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think it's like, about sixty dollars a week for two children if I'm not mistaken.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah, uh, do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um, depending upon the field, I know there are some fields which a person should go to the school, that school, all four years, but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary.|b qy sd sd

A|Right.|b
B|But from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, uh, with dropouts. Uh, when I was in Minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that, uh, on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up|sd sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city, uh, Minneapolis.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they just didn't come to school.|sd
A|That's really sad isn't it?|qy
B|And I cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school.|sd
A|Right. Well just recently in the paper here, were articles about students, uh, working. High school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades.|b sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But then the follow-up the next day was, I was kind of glad to see, because it, it said that, you know, yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway, that, you know, handling a job was very possible. You know, and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors.|sd sd sd ^q sd
B|I think so too.|aa
A|You know like, what are their plans after high school, you know. And what's their home situation. You know that,|sd sd %
B|The home is the key.|sv
A|Right. Right.|b
B|I think really is because if the home, does not place a high priority on education and, uh, the main goal is making money now and it may be a survival thing  for the family, which you can understand.|sv sv sv
A|Right. Sure.|b b
B|So, uh,|%
A|But there can still be an attitude of|sv
B|Right.|b
A|you know, this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now, but, but that the most important thing is still, you know  getting your education.|^q sv
B|Your education.|^2
A|Well when they meant, said the, the topic, you know, of what's wrong with the public schools, my, my first impulse was it isn't really what's wrong with the public, public schools. It's what's wrong with families|sd sd
B|That's right. It's what's wrong with families and if, if children come to school, yes, insecure and their biggest concern is survival both at home,|aa sd sv
A|Right.|b
B|they don't know what to expect at home. They don't feel secure there, they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex.|sv sv sv
A|Right.|b
B|For example that child that was shot.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, how can they concentrate on schooling? I agree  with you,|qh sd
A|Right.|b
B|I think that's the main problem.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And schools now are supposed to solve social problems, uh, mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security.|sd
A|Huh. Yeah.|% b
B|And that's overwhelming.|sv
A|Well we've got, uh, you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor. And that's just really not enough.|sd sd sd
B|No. It isn't.|aa aa
A|And I was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said, oh, but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are, you know, at a tougher and rougher age and all that. But, you know, part of my feeling is that if you solve, help them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there.|sd sd sd
B|True. I think they, there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary. We didn't even have counselors in elementary.|aa sv sd sd
A|Really.|b
B|We have always, though, had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and they divided them up between three counselors but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work.|sd sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So they started, uh, dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees  through  you know, through all three years of middle school.|sd
A|Uh-huh. They  they do that here. Uh-huh.|b sd b
B|And I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|If they have a rapport with their counselor. Now if they don't, I hope they have the flexibility to be able to change  a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them.|sv sd
A|yeah.|b
B|And occasionally that happens.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, it is frightening Because, uh, education is the key to our future|sv
A|Yes, it certainly is.|aa aa
B|and, uh, if we have children who are not getting their education, for one reason or another, then what are we going to do with them?|qh
A|Yeah. That's right|aa aa
B|What's going to happen to them? Are they going to be able to, uh, work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people  in prison.|qh qh qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|And our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|That's no good.|sv
A|I'm on that, um, campus strategic planning committee for my school.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh, they have all these different names for things, strategies and all these different things. But, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value. Then I think they decided to strike economic.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Anyway, you know, the point was, what happens when public education fails? You know  will then people go to private schools?|sd qh
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, well, what kind of a situation do they get there and what are, you know, and what kind of state are we in if, if most people are going to private schools.|qh qh qh
B|Well I think, uh, one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try to educate everyone.|sv
A|Right. Uh-huh.|b b
B|That's one of the things that we do. We try to educate everyone.|sd sd
A|That's right. That's right.|aa aa
B|We're the only country in the world that does.|sd
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
B|And let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing, you know, to work  and have, uh, some ability.|sd
A|Uh-huh Yeah.|b b
B|They can do that.|sd
A|and one of the Plano school district's, you know, goals is that they will graduate every child that, uh, that is here in the ninth grade, I believe  it's something like that,|sd h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's worded. And, uh, I don't know|sd h
B|Well you know if we can keep them in school.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh|b
A|That's  so important,|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh. I see. Uh|b bk
B|So what do you do?|qo
A|Well, that's basically what we do. Uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest|sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night|sd sd
B|Wow|ba
A|and he works, and my husband works full times days and so we have four checks, but that works out nice because we get paid every week and  so that does help,|sd sd sd sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|that helps a lot. And then, uh, we don't have a lot extra for extra spending, so it's pretty well ear marked.|sd sd sd
B|Yeah. All allocated out.|aa bf
A|Yeah|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah. Every penny is ear marked but, uh it, we have found that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up. In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half, but and divide those up between all, uh-huh.|b sd sd sd sd sd %
B|All the checks, yeah.|bf b
A|And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or,|sd sd %
B|Right. Yeah, we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.|aa aa sd
A|That's true.|aa
B|We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know, we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have,|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand. We thought it uh, thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that|sd sd sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so,|%
A|Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes|sv
B|Yeah|b
A|and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget, but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying, my word where did all that money  go.|sv sv sv
B|That's a lot of money, but|bf %
A|Where does it go?|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh|%
B|But,|%
A|and also we have found that if we write down, and we did this. We are not real consistent with this, but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought when, you know, every pay check|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's, we should cause it does help.|sd sd sd % sd
B|Yeah, the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit|aa sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say, oh, it's gone|sd

A|Hi, Maureen. How are you?|fp fp
B|All right.|fp
A|Well do you have a family budget?|qy
B|No, we probably should, but we haven't. So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable.|nn sd sd ad
A|Okay. We do a few things, and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds. I, I'm an accountant.|aa sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, he has an M B A, so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that. So|sd sd %
B|Um, okay.|b
A|Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget. Every month, my husband, uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, you know, X amount of dollars for the month, and then that money is used during that month. We have a certain budget.|sd sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby-sitting, things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, uh, we don't buy any more milk|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But, uh, we've gotten pretty good at it, we've been doing it a couple of years now.|sv sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, we, our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent and, you know to make us feel uncomfortable.|sv sv
B|Hm.|%
A|And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, uh, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month, but generally, we always make it.|sd sd sd
B|What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for, the, you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort, or, like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for?|qw qrr
A|Right. Well, uh, most of our medical things, we don't, uh, have to worry about, because of insurance and they're, they're relatively small. Uh, we've been lucky. In the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't. For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things. Like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not.|b sd sd sv sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So, I mean, and I, I can't really remember what it is.|% sd
B|Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account or,|qy %
A|It's all part of the savings account. We just keep track of it on paper. Uh, you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account. We decide, okay, you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars. You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know,|sd sd sd sd sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever. Uh, and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up. Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day.|sd sd sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|So, but, we have the money set aside, so if it does it's not going to kill us.|sd sd
B|Hm.|b
A|Uh, so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined, so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through.|sv sv
B|Okay, then, so like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing?|b qw
A|Well, in.|%
B|Or like what, what percent, do you then save or something?|qo
A|Uh, we have a lot of different things. Right now, we save about twenty-five percent of our, of our pay.|sd sd
B|Hm, okay.|bk
A|It, and it goes toward different things, it's for, you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, uh, breaks down, something like that.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and we also put money aside for our kids college.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Neither of us had any help with our college degrees, and just this last month we paid off my final school loan. So|sd sd %
B|Oh.|b
A|We're starting our kids a little bit early.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|Do you, uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things?|qy
B|Checking account a lot, uh, not so much credit cards.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|and so pretty much now, uh, we don't use them too much. If we travel or something, yeah. But, you know. Standard, we usually don't.|sd sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or if it, it is a purchase, uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes. You know, so it isn't any extended, uh, it may be that I picked up something at the store, but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then, so it's not any, you know, uh, build up on the charge cards at all.|sd sd sd sd sd
A|That's good.|ba
B|And, but that hasn't always been the case So, I'm kind of, I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, uh, you know, in the past, and I don't have, you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer.|sd % sv sv
A|Oh, and it's not deductible anymore.|sv
B|Yeah, well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow. But, uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks.|b sd sd
A|Yeah. We did, we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things.|b sd sd
B|Hm.|b
A|And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget. Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be,|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we kept track of everything for a month. You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, and from that built, you know, a cash budget.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b b
A|So now, I mean, I have, I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say.|% sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else, and some months it may be different.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing, but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, uh, utilities and, uh, the house payment and all that.|sv sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|those are things you don't really have much control over.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment. I mean, but again it's a set amount every month. And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that.|sv sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We, we don't, we still have fun on things|sv
B|Yeah. Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house, do you know, how did your budget work or did you have a budget to, uh, get your down payment going to get a house?|b sd qw qrr
A|Well, no not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything.|nn sv sv
B|Huh.|b
A|So, we got into it fairly cheaply, and then, uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house.|sv sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily|sd
B|Okay, uh, yeah, I just keep thinking all the time I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you know, your priority, at least mine is to save for the house. But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment. You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime.|b b sd sv sv sv
A|Sure, I know. That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education, I mean jeez, they are one and four We have got a long time to save, my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually.|aa aa sv sd sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, no, no|sv sv
B|Well, I know, but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you know we make X amount of money and where is it. I mean you look around and you go,  where is it,|ba sv sv sd
A|What do you do with it, I know.|^2 ba
B|you, you haven't made, uh, big purchases and that's the easier thing to see, if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V, or something like that.|sv sv sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
B|But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries, and stuff. That you don't have tangible, I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone.|sd sd sd
A|Yeah, it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things. My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work.|b sv sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And that's all he has, he has a ten dollar bill.|sd sd
B|Huh.|b
A|And, I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The other times, he'll, uh, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, but he keeps himself on that, I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch.|sd sd

And yet, I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for, for this country and yet, and yet, I know that I, that, and I, I, when I was in school it was always the tired, the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore.

B|Uh, well, I like to think of it as a hobby, but I, I guess also, partly out of necessity. Just repairing things around the house. Uh, a few years ago, uh, we needed, uh, they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and, uh, it actually worked pretty well and over the years I've, I've refined those plans. I got myself a router and I'm, I'm very good at making book shelves.|sd sd sd sv sd sd sd

A|Well, I'll have to come and see them That sounds like a good idea. I, you know, and that's, that is right, it is out of necessity because lot of the things that, uh, well, we can't be able to afford, but also I, I sometimes think that, uh, I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and, and, uh, to work with my hands and, uh, sounds like you got some real nice tools, too.

B|The latest project that I've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a, a cabinet to, to put a T V in.|sd
A|Oh, a entertainment type center?|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|Oh.|b
B|And it, that's works well because you can design it to, to suit whatever equipment you have so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the, the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment.|sv sd
A|Right. Right, right.|b b b

A|Oh.|b
B|Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|Whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw.|sv
A|Well and with a radial arm saw, if you do have a, a big piece of wood that you need to rip, like you say, or cut, you wouldn't be able to do that. Uh, but, uh, yeah, a table saw does take a lot of time, excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment.|sv % sv

B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|In recent years it has just really, really changed a lot.|sv
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b
A|And, and I think that, uh, you know, the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management, but I think they have got a long way to go|sd sv
B|Oh, definitely, definitely.|aa aa
A|There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, uh, chairmen of the board, chair persons, uh, if you if you will, of the board are women in this country.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|So, there are some, some strides to be made there.|sv
B|Yeah, yeah.|b b

B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah,|b b b b
A|And, uh, uh, I guess my, I, uh, the one, my one bad thing is that I am, that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, I think she would have really, she would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able to succeed, in her, generation.|sd

A|so, that is recognized, as, uh, you know, a place where women should be.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b b
A|But, uh, I do not know, I, you see it in, uh, also in, uh, like in church, uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers. In, uh, you know, in protestant congregations|h sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and, uh, it will be interesting to see if, if Roman Catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women in, in the role of priest. I I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or, you know, what you know about that.|sv qy^d

A|No, probably not. Huh-uh. So, uh, uh, how about, what in particular would you think that, uh, women still, other than the work place, where women still are being, uh, oh, you know, found wanting, you know, or not as highly regarded as men would be.

A|The, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war?|sd

B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b b

B|Huh. Yeah, yeah.|% b b

A|and, uh, one of, one of the men who was a, I do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was, very high.|sd sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He said, it's just a personal thing with me. I mean, I can not be real, you know I can not tell you why I feel this way, but I just would rather have, uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman. I thought, well, at least he was honest But, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, I am sure|sd ^q ^q sd sv
B|There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women|sv
A|Yeah, right You know, Neil, well Neil as far as I am concerned, and I could be wrong about this, but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength, to do something.|aa aa sv
B|Yeah, yeah, yeah.|b b b
A|Uh, because, I would think, I think, you know, mentally, uh, and emotionally, I think women can handle a job and, every bit as well.|sd

But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening, and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.|sd sd sd sd sd

A|Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?|qy

You know, it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and, you know  then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.|nn sv sd sd sd

B|Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.

A|So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?|qy

B|Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.|sv

A|So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.|bf
